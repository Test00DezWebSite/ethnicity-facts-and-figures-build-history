These are used to make estimates for the 22.6 million households in England. \r\n\r\nThe EHS is a national survey of people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of homes in England. \r\n \r\nThe information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.\r\n\r\nThe EHS has ethnicity information on the household reference person as well as all other members of the household. The \u2018household reference person\u2019 is the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented, or who is otherwise responsible for it. \r\n\r\nSome households have people from different ethnic backgrounds; where this happens, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person. \r\n \r\nNearly every household reference person \u2013 more than 99.8% interviewed \u2013 provided information on their ethnicity.\r\n\r\nAt the geographical level, the data is shown for the nine regions of England: North East, North West, Yorkshire & Humberside, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London, South East and the South West.", "summary": "* in 2015/16, 4.3 million (19%) of the 22.6 million households in England lived in a non-decent home\r\n*  compared with the 19% of White British households who lived in a non-decent home, White Irish households were less likely to live in a non-decent home and Pakistani households were more likely to do so\r\n*   the survey estimates show other differences between ethnic minority households living in non-decent homes compared to White British households in this sample \u2013 however, these are not reliable enough to draw any conclusions about differences between these groups in  the total population", "geographic_coverage": "England", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2014/15 and 2015/16 (combined)", "need_to_know": "Compared with White British households, ethnic minority households tend to be younger, to have lived in England for a shorter time and to be located in urban areas. They are also likely to live in larger households.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has added together 2 years of data (2014/15 and 2015/16) from the English Housing Survey (EHS).\r\n\r\nInformation about households in the EHS Headline and Annual reports is normally based on a 12-month period (April to March). As the statistics on this page combine data from 2014/15 and 2015/16, the numbers here may not match the figures in those individual reports.\r\n\r\nThe commentary has focused on findings based on subgroups of at least 30 households to ensure that we report reliable findings. For this reason, estimates for Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller, Mixed White and Asian, and Any Other Black  households have not been presented in some of the tables or charts.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to look in detail at the characteristics of the type of households that live in non-decent homes. This is because the sample sizes of individual ethnic groups when further broken down by other characteristics such as income, socio-economic group, region or age are not large enough to give reliable estimates. \r\n\r\nThe EHS is a \u2018sample survey\u2019. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach \u2018findings\u2019) about the total population.\r\n \r\nFor example, EHS findings might include the percentage of households living in non-decent homes.\r\n \r\nUnless stated otherwise, the commentary for this data only includes reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings.\r\n \r\nFindings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "This data uses the standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 Census.\r\n\r\nWhite:\r\n\r\n* English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British\r\n* Irish\r\n* Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller\r\n* Any other White background\r\n\r\nMixed/Multiple ethnic groups:\r\n\r\n* White and Black Caribbean\r\n* White and Black African\r\n* White and Asian\r\n* Any other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background\r\n\r\nAsian/Asian British:\r\n\r\n* Indian\r\n* Pakistani\r\n* Bangladeshi\r\n* Chinese\r\n* Any other Asian background\r\n\r\nBlack/African/Caribbean/Black British:\r\n\r\n* African\r\n* Caribbean\r\n* Any other Black/African/Caribbean background\r\n\r\nOther ethnic group:\r\n\r\n* Arab\r\n* Any other ethnic group", "ethnicity_definition_detail": "", "source_text": "English Housing Survey", "source_url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey", "department_source": "Department for Communities & Local Government", "published_date": "-", "last_update_date": "-", "next_update_date": "", "frequency": "Annual", "related_publications": "", "contact_name": "Edward Aveyard", "contact_phone": "0303 444 1588", "contact_email": "Edward.Aveyard@communities.gsi.gov.uk", "data_source_purpose": "The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). \r\nIt collects information about:\r\n\r\n* people\u2019s housing circumstances\r\n* the condition and energy efficiency of housing", "methodology": "The EHS consists of:\r\n\r\n* face-to-face interviews with a random sample of about 13,300 households a year\r\n* a physical inspection of the homes of about 6,000 of the interviewed households \u2013 these are selected at random and carried out by a surveyor\r\n\r\nThe surveyor also inspects a random sample of about 200 properties identified by the interviewer as vacant.\r\n\r\nWeighting:\r\n\r\nWeighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.\r\nFor example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.\r\n\r\nStatisticians rebalance or \u2018weight\u2019 the survey results to more accurately represent the general population.
