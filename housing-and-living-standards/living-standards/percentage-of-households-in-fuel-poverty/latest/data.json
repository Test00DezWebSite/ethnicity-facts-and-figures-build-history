The data is broken down by ethnic group.\r\n \r\nFuel poverty in England is measured using the Low Income High Costs (LIHC) indicator. Under the LIHC indicator, the people in a household are considered to be fuel poor if:\r\n \r\n* the cost of fuel needed to keep their home warm, well-lit and with running appliances and hot water for everyday use is greater than the average for households across the country (the national median level)\r\n* subtracting this amount of fuel costs, all their regular debt payments and expenses (including a mortgage) from their income results in an income below the official poverty line\r\n\r\nThree factors determine whether a household is fuel poor:\r\n \r\n* household income\r\n* household energy requirements\r\n* fuel prices", "summary": "* households from ethnic minorities (other than White ethnic minorities) were more likely to be living in fuel poverty than White households\r\n* in 2015, the estimated number of households in England in fuel poverty was 2.5 million \u2013 approximately 11% of all households", "geographic_coverage": "England", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2003 to 2015", "need_to_know": "The ethnicity of the \u2018household reference person\u2019 is used to determine the ethnicity of households in fuel poverty statistics.\r\n\r\nThe household reference person is the person in whose name the home is owned or rented or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation.\r\n\r\nFor joint owners or joint tenants, the household reference person is whoever has the highest income. If the incomes are equal, it is the oldest person.\r\n\r\nSome households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds.

These households had both a face-to-face interview and a physical survey carried out by a qualified surveyor. \r\n\r\nAround 10% (1,200) of the surveyed households were in fuel poverty. Of these 1,200, about 17% (200) were from an ethnic minority household (other than White ethnic minorities).\r\n\r\nWeighting\r\n\r\nSurveys seek information about a particular group of people \u2013 we call this the target population.\r\n \r\nEvery target population will have a particular age and gender profile \u2013 for example, teachers are predominantly female and under 50. Some target populations will also have a regional profile \u2013 for example, they might be clustered in a particular part of the country. \r\n\r\nSurveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (reach \u2018findings\u2019) about everyone within that population.\r\n \r\nFor those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.\r\n \r\nWhere this isn\u2019t the case (because some people haven\u2019t responded, for example) analysts use statistical tools to \u2018weight\u2019 the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately.
