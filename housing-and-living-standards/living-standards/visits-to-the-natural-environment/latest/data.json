This includes all green open spaces in and around towns and cities, as well as the countryside and coastline. \r\n\r\nVisits can last for anything from a few minutes to all day. They may include time spent in nature close to a person\u2019s home or workplace, further afield, or on holiday in England. Time spent in household gardens is not included.\r\n\r\nVisits to the natural environment are measured by the Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE). This is a survey is commissioned by Natural England, with support from Defra and the Forestry Commission.\r\n\r\nFrequency of visits to the natural environment is analysed by: \r\n\r\n* ethnicity\r\n* socio-economic group\r\n* whether respondents live in the countryside or a city (urban/rural location)\r\n\r\nThe survey\u2019s respondents were adults aged 16 years and over, and the survey asked whether respondents had visited the natural environment in the last 7 days.

For this reason, you should use caution when interpreting them.\r\n\r\nEstimates based on a larger number of respondents are generally more reliable. Therefore, the smaller numbers of respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that estimates for these groups are less reliable than estimates for White people. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo increase the reliability of the date, the analysis combines information taken from surveys carried out between 2009 and 2016. This means that references to visiting the natural environment in the \u2018previous 12 months\u2019 or the \u2018previous 7 days\u2019 could refer to visits which took place at any point during the time covered by these surveys. \r\n\r\nCertain standard testing methods weren't used to determine whether observed differences between ethnic groups are statistically significant.

In each wave, interviews are undertaken with a representative sample of the English adult population (aged 16 and over) with a sample of at least 80 achieved across at least 100 sample points (ie, 80% of desired sample). In each year included in this analysis, between 45,000 and 49,000 people have been interviewed, resulting in a total sample of just over 326,000 respondents.\r\n\r\nThe Monitor of Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) weighting system is applied to the sample to provide estimates of the total volume of visits taken to the natural environment by the English adult population. Weighting provides results representative of the adult population and the visits they have taken over the study period. \r\n\r\nEach month\u2019s data is weighted on the basis of: \r\n\r\n* age and sex (for example, males 16 to 24, females 85+) \r\n* area of residence\r\n* social grade\r\n* presence of children in the household\r\n* sex and working status (for example, male full-time)\r\n* presence of a dog in the household\r\n* urban/rural residence\r\n\r\nRespondents are asked a range of questions about visits to the natural environment over the previous 7 days. \r\n\r\nThe socio-economic classifications used are:\r\n\r\n* A: High managerial, administrative or professional\r\n* B: Intermediate managerial, administrative or professional\r\n* C1: Supervisory, clerical and junior managerial, administrative or professional\r\n* C2: Skilled manual workers\r\n* D: Semi and unskilled manual workers\r\n* E: State pensioners, casual or lowest grade workers, unemployed with state benefits only\r\n\r\nSocial grade is a classification system based on occupation and it enables a household and all its members to be classified according to the occupation of the \u2018household reference person\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe household reference person is the person in whose name the dwelling is owned or rented or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation. Some households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds. In these circumstances, the ethnic background of the household is defined by the ethnic background of the household reference person..  \r\n\r\nMENE uses a sampling approach which involves the weekly selection of around 100 interviewing locations (sampling points) throughout England. In each of these locations interviewers find and interview a sample of respondents meeting demographic quota targets which reflect the wider population. \r\n\r\nThis approach could under-represent those types of people less likely to be available when fieldwork is undertaken, including regular recreation participants who are generally less likely to be at home. To reduce this potential bias, interviewing is conducted at different times of day and on different days of the week.", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "Figures are not presented in the
