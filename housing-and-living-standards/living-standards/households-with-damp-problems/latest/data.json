{"guid": "DCLG 005", "title": "Housing with damp problems", "measure_summary": "This data measures the percentage of households in England who had damp problems, broken down by ethnicity. The damp problem could have been in one or more rooms in the property.\r\n\r\nThe figures are percentages of all households within each ethnic group.\r\n\r\nA home with a damp problem is one with any of the following:\r\n\r\n* rising damp\r\n* penetrating damp or serious condensation/mould in any of the rooms inspected\r\n\r\nRising damp refers to the slow upward movement of water in the lower sections of walls and other ground-supported structures. Penetrating damp is another common form of dampness where water penetrates the outside of a building (through walls, roofs or windows) and appears inside.\r\n\r\nThe figures come from the English Housing Survey 2014/15 and 2015/16.\r\n\r\nThe survey involves face-to-face interviews with about 13,300 randomly selected households every year. These are used to make estimates for the 22.6 million households in England. \r\n\r\nThe EHS is a national survey of people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of homes in England. \r\n \r\nThe information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.\r\n\r\nThe EHS has ethnicity information on the household reference person as well as all other members of the household. The \u2018household reference person\u2019 is the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented, or who is otherwise responsible for it. \r\n\r\nSome households have people from different ethnic backgrounds; where this happens, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person. \r\n \r\nNearly every household reference person \u2013 more than 99.8% interviewed \u2013 provided information on their ethnicity.", "summary": "* in 2015, 4% of households in England lived in a home with damp problems \u2013 around a million homes\r\n\r\n* Black African, Pakistani and Any other White households were more likely to live in a home with damp problems compared with White British households", "geographic_coverage": "England", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2014/15 and 2015/16 (combined)", "need_to_know": "Compared with White British households, ethnic minority households tend to be younger, to have lived in England for a shorter time, live in rented accommodation and be located in urban areas. This may explain some of the differences in the conditions of the housing that ethnic minority households live in.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the Department for Communities and Local Government has added together 2 years of data (2014/15 and 2015/16) from the English Housing Survey (EHS).\r\n\r\nInformation about households in the EHS Headline and Annual reports is normally based on a 12-month period (April to March). As the statistics on this page combine data from 2014/15 and 2015/16, the numbers here may not match the figures in those individual reports.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that we do not identify individual households and we report findings that are reliable, subgroups that had fewer than 30 households or that had fewer than five households with damp problems are excluded. For this reason, estimates for White Irish; Gypsy Traveller or Irish Traveller; Mixed White and Asian, Mixed White and Black Caribbean; Any Other Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups; Chinese; Other Black background; and Arab have not been presented in some of the tables or charts.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to look in detail at the characteristics of the type of households with damp problems. This is because the sample sizes of individual ethnic groups when further broken down by other characteristics such as income, socio-economic group, region or age are not large enough to give reliable estimates.\r\n\r\nThe EHS is a \u2018sample survey\u2019. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach \u2018findings\u2019) about the total population.\r\n \r\nFor example, EHS findings might include the percentage of households with damp problems.\r\n \r\nUnless stated otherwise, the commentary for this data only includes reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings.\r\n \r\nFindings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "This data uses the standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 Census.\r\n\r\nWhite:\r\n\r\n* English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British\r\n* Irish\r\n* Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller\r\n* Any other White background\r\n\r\nMixed/Multiple ethnic groups:\r\n\r\n* White and Black Caribbean\r\n* White and Black African\r\n* White and Asian\r\n* Any other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background\r\n\r\nAsian/Asian British:\r\n\r\n* Indian\r\n* Pakistani\r\n* Bangladeshi\r\n* Chinese\r\n* Any other Asian background\r\n\r\nBlack/African/Caribbean/Black British:\r\n\r\n* African\r\n* Caribbean\r\n* Any other Black/African/Caribbean background\r\n\r\nOther ethnic group:\r\n\r\n* Arab\r\n* Any other ethnic group", "ethnicity_definition_detail": "", "source_text": "English Housing Survey", "source_url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey", "department_source": "Department for Communities and Local Government", "published_date": "-", "last_update_date": "-", "next_update_date": "", "frequency": "Annual", "related_publications": "", "contact_name": "Edward Aveyard", "contact_phone": "0303 444 1588", "contact_email": "Edward.Aveyard@communities.gsi.gov.uk", "data_source_purpose": "The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). \r\nIt collects information about:\r\n\r\n* people\u2019s housing circumstances\r\n* the condition and energy efficiency of housing", "methodology": "The EHS consists of:\r\n\r\n*  face-to-face interviews with a random sample of about 13,300 households a year\r\n* a physical inspection of the homes of about 6,000 of the interviewed households \u2013 these are selected at random and carried out by a surveyor\r\n\r\nThe surveyor also inspects a random sample of about 200 properties identified by the interviewer as vacant.\r\n\r\nWeighting:\r\n\r\nWeighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population.\r\n\r\nFor example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.\r\n\r\nStatisticians rebalance or \u2018weight\u2019 the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. \r\n\r\nIn the EHS, weighting makes the results more representative of the 22.6 million households in England.", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has \u2018suppressed\u2019 estimates based on fewer than 30 households.\r\n\r\n\u2018Suppression\u2019 means these figures have not been included in the data because the numbers involved are too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.\r\n\r\nWhere the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual\u2019s identity could be revealed, some other figures have also been excluded.", "disclosure_control": "The data is deposited in the UK Data Archive, after applying a wide range of disclosure control.\r\n\r\nStrictly disclosure-controlled data in the form of derived variables is available under the End-User Licence (for example, ethnicity is given as White/ethnic minority).\r\n\r\nData sets with some more details are made available under Special Licence after the user has applied to the English Housing Survey team for access.\r\n\r\nData that could potentially reveal someone\u2019s identity (such as a postcode) is available only through UKDA Secure Access.
