The survey involves face-to-face interviews with about 13,300 randomly selected households every year. These are used to make estimates for the 22.6 million households in England as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe EHS is a national survey of people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of homes in England. \r\n \r\nThe information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.\r\n\r\nThe EHS has ethnicity information on the household reference person as well as all other members of the household. The \u2018household reference person\u2019 is the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented, or who is otherwise responsible for it. \r\n\r\nSome households have people from different ethnic backgrounds; where this happens, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person. \r\n \r\nNearly every household reference person \u2013 more than 99.8% interviewed \u2013 provided information on their ethnicity.", "summary": "* in 2015/16, 14.3 million out of 22.6 million households in England (63%) owned their home either outright or with a mortgage\r\n\r\n* one million out of 14.3 million homeowners in England (7%) bought their current home with financial help from family members\r\n\r\n* There is little difference across all ethnic groups, including White British, in receiving financial help from family members to buy their homes", "geographic_coverage": "England", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2014/15 and 2015/16 (combined)", "need_to_know": "So that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the data is taken from the English Housing Survey (EHS) 2014/15 and 2015/16, combined.\r\n\r\nInformation about households available from the EHS Headline and Annual Reports is normally based on a single year of the survey, so some of the statistics used here may not match those in the Headline and Annual Reports.\r\n\r\nThe commentary has focused on findings based on at least 30 households to ensure that we report reliable findings. For this reason, information is not provided about households from Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller, White and Black Caribbean, White and Black African, Other Mixed, Other Black or Arab  ethnic backgrounds.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to look in detail into the financial help owner occupiers got from their family when they bought their home.  This is because the sample sizes of individual ethnic groups when further broken down by other characteristics, such as income, socio-economic group, region or age are not large enough to give reliable estimates. \r\n\r\nThe EHS is a \u2018sample survey\u2019: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings\u2019) about the total population.\r\n \r\nFor example, EHS findings might include the percentage of households who get help from their family to buy their own home.\r\n \r\nThe commentary for this data only includes reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings.\r\n \r\nFindings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "For comparisons made at national level (England), this data uses the standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 census.\r\n\r\nWhite:\r\n\r\n* English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British\r\n\r\n* Irish\r\n\r\n* Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller \r\n\r\n* Any other White background\r\n\r\nMixed/Multiple ethnic groups:\r\n\r\n* White and Black Caribbean\r\n\r\n* White and Black African\r\n\r\n* White and Asian\r\n\r\n* Any other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background\r\n\r\nAsian/Asian British:\r\n\r\n* Indian\r\n\r\n* Pakistani\r\n\r\n* Bangladeshi\r\n\r\n* Chinese\r\n\r\n* Any other Asian background\r\n\r\nBlack/African/Caribbean/Black British:\r\n\r\n* African\r\n\r\n* Caribbean\r\n\r\n* Any other Black/African/Caribbean background\r\n\r\nOther ethnic group:\r\n\r\n* Arab\r\n\r\n* Any other ethnic group", "ethnicity_definition_detail": "", "source_text": "English Housing Survey", "source_url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey", "department_source": "Department for Communities and Local Government", "published_date": "7th March 2017", "last_update_date": "7th March 2017", "next_update_date": "February 2018", "frequency": "Annually", "related_publications": "", "contact_name": "Edward Aveyard", "contact_phone": "0303 444 1588", "contact_email": "Edward.Aveyard@communities.gsi.gov.u", "data_source_purpose": "The English Housing Survey is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).
