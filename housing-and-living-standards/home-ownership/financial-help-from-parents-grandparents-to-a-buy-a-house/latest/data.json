The survey involves face-to-face interviews with 13,300 randomly selected households every year. These are used to make estimates for the 22 million households in England as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe EHS is a national survey of people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of homes in England. \r\n \r\nThe information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.\r\n\r\nThe EHS has ethnicity information on the household reference person as well as all other members of the household. The \u2018household reference person\u2019 is the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented, or who is otherwise responsible for it. \r\n\r\nSome households have people from different ethnic backgrounds; where this happens, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person. \r\n \r\nNearly every household reference person \u2013 more than 99.8% interviewed \u2013 provided information on their ethnicity.

For this reason, information is not provided about people from African, Any other Black background, Arab, Bangladeshi, Gypsy, Irish Traveller, or Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to provide information on people\u2019s housing circumstances which is further broken down by other factors, such as income, socio-economic group, region or age. This is because the sample sizes of individual ethnic groups when further broken down by other characteristics are not large enough to give reliable estimates. \r\n\r\nThe EHS is a \u2018sample survey\u2019: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings\u2019) about the total population.\r\n \r\nFor example, EHS findings might include the percentage of households who get help from their family to buy their own home.\r\n \r\nThe commentary for this data only includes reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings.\r\n \r\nFindings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "For comparisons made at national level (England), this data uses the standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 census.\r\n\r\nWhite:\r\n\r\n* English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British\r\n\r\n* Irish\r\n\r\n* Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller \r\n\r\n* Any other White background\r\n\r\nMixed/Multiple ethnic groups:\r\n\r\n* White and Black Caribbean\r\n\r\n* White and Black African\r\n\r\n* White and Asian\r\n\r\n* Any other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background\r\n\r\nAsian/Asian British:\r\n\r\n* Indian\r\n\r\n* Pakistani\r\n\r\n* Bangladeshi\r\n\r\n* Chinese\r\n\r\n* Any other Asian background\r\n\r\nBlack/African/Caribbean/Black British:\r\n\r\n* African\r\n\r\n* Caribbean\r\n\r\n* Any other Black/African/Caribbean background\r\n\r\nOther ethnic group:\r\n\r\n* Arab\r\n\r\n* Any other ethnic group", "ethnicity_definition_detail": "", "source_text": "English Housing Survey 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16", "source_url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey#2013-to-2014", "department_source": "Department for Communities and Local Government", "published_date": "7th March 2017", "last_update_date": "7th March 2017", "next_update_date": "February 2018", "frequency": "Annually", "related_publications": "https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/english-housing-survey#2013-to-2014", "contact_name": "Edward Aveyard", "contact_phone": "0303 444 1588", "contact_email": "Edward.Aveyard@communities.gsi.gov.u", "data_source_purpose": "The English Housing Survey is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG).
