They are also likely to live in larger households.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the Department for Communities and Local Government has added together 2 years of data (2014/15 and 2015/16) from the English Housing Survey (EHS).\r\n\r\nInformation about households in the EHS Headline and Annual reports is normally based on a 12-month period (April to March). As the statistics on this page combine data from 2014/15 and 2015/16, the numbers here may not match the figures in those individual reports.\r\n\r\nThe commentary has focused on findings based on subgroups of at least 30 households to ensure that we report reliable findings.\r\n\r\nThe EHS is a \u2018sample survey\u2019. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach \u2018findings\u2019) about the total population.\r\n \r\nFor example, EHS findings might include the average deposit paid by first-time buyers. In 2015/16, the average deposit that first-time buyers paid on their home was \u00a348,831.\r\n \r\nUnless stated otherwise, the commentary for this data only includes reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings.\r\n \r\nFindings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they  are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample..", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "The following 2 categories were used:\r\n\r\n* White British\r\n* Other (all other groups, including White ethnic minorities and all other ethnic minorities)\r\n\r\nThese categories were chosen due to the small numbers involved. \r\n\r\nMore detailed comparisons using the 18 standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 Census are not possible.
