{"guid": "DCLG 010", "title": "Age of first-time buyers", "measure_summary": "This data measures the average age of first-time buyers when they\u2019re buying a home in England, broken down by ethnicity. \r\n\r\nFirst-time buyers are home buyers who, when surveyed in 2014/15 or 2015/16, had bought a home for the first time in the previous 3 years.\r\n\r\nThe figures come from the English Housing Survey 2014/15 and 2015/16. \r\n\r\nThe survey involves face-to-face interviews with about 13,300 randomly selected households every year. These are used to make estimates for the 22.6 million households in England. \r\n\r\nThe EHS is a national survey of people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of homes in England. \r\n \r\nThe information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.\r\n\r\nThe EHS has ethnicity information on the household reference person as well as all other members of the household. The \u2018household reference person\u2019 is the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented, or who is otherwise responsible for it. \r\n\r\nSome households have people from different ethnic backgrounds; where this happens, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person. \r\n \r\nNearly every household reference person \u2013 more than 99.8% interviewed \u2013 provided information on their ethnicity.", "summary": "* the average age of a White British first-time buyer was 33\r\n\r\n* the average age of Black African, Other Asian and Any Other ethnic group first time buyers was higher than White British first-time buyers", "geographic_coverage": "England", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2014/15 and 2015/16 (combined)", "need_to_know": "Compared with White British households, ethnic minority households tend to be younger, to have lived in England for a shorter time and to be located in urban areas. They are also likely to live in larger households. This may explain some of the differences in the average age of ethnic minority households when they buy their first home.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the Department for Communities and Local Government has added together 2 years of data (2014/15 and 2015/16) from the English Housing Survey (EHS).\r\n\r\nInformation about households in the EHS Headline and Annual reports is normally based on a 12-month period (April to March). As the statistics on this page combine data from 2014/15 and 2015/16, the numbers here may not match the figures in those individual reports.\r\n\r\nThe commentary has focused on findings based on subgroups of at least 30 households to ensure that we report reliable findings. For this reason, estimates for Bangladeshi, Other Black, Mixed White and Asian, Mixed White and Black African, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, Other Mixed, Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Travellers and Arab households have not been presented in some of the tables or charts.\r\n\r\nThe EHS is a \u2018sample survey\u2019. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach \u2018findings\u2019) about the total population.\r\n \r\nFor example, EHS findings include the average age of first-time buyers. In 2015/16, the average age at which first-time buyers bought their home was 33.\r\n \r\nUnless stated otherwise, the commentary for this data only includes reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings.\r\n \r\nFindings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "This data uses the standardised ethnic groups based on the 2011 Census.\r\n\r\nWhite:\r\n\r\n* English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British\r\n* Irish\r\n* Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller\r\n* Any other White background\r\n\r\nMixed/Multiple ethnic groups:\r\n\r\n* White and Black Caribbean\r\n* White and Black African\r\n* White and Asian\r\n* Any other Mixed/Multiple ethnic background\r\n\r\nAsian/Asian British:\r\n\r\n* Indian\r\n* Pakistani\r\n* Bangladeshi\r\n* Chinese\r\n* Any other Asian background\r\n\r\nBlack/African/Caribbean/Black British:\r\n\r\n* African\r\n* Caribbean\r\n* Any other Black/African/Caribbean background\r\n\r\nOther ethnic group:\r\n\r\n* Arab\r\n* Any other ethnic group", "ethnicity_definition_detail": "", "source_text": "English Housing Survey", "source_url": "https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-housing-survey-2015-to-2016-headline-report", "department_source": "Department for Communities and Local Government", "published_date": "-", "last_update_date": "-", "next_update_date": "", "frequency": "Annual", "related_publications": "", "contact_name": "Edward Aveyard", "contact_phone": "0303 444 1588", "contact_email": "Edward.Aveyard@communities.gsi.gov.uk", "data_source_purpose": "The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). \r\nIt collects information about:\r\n\r\n* people\u2019s housing circumstances\r\n* the condition and energy efficiency of housing", "methodology": "The EHS consists of:\r\n\r\n* face-to-face interviews with a random sample of about 13,300 households a year\r\n* a physical inspection of the homes of about 6,000 of the interviewed households \u2013 these are selected at random and carried out by a surveyor\r\n\r\nThe surveyor also inspects a random sample of about 200 properties identified by the interviewer as vacant.\r\n\r\nWeighting\r\n\r\nWeighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population\r\n.\r\nFor example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.\r\n\r\nStatisticians rebalance or \u2018weight\u2019 the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. \r\n\r\nIn the EHS, weighting makes the results more representative of the 22 million households in England.", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has \u2018suppressed\u2019 estimates based on fewer than 30 households.\r\n\r\n\u2018Suppression\u2019 means these figures have not been included in the data because the numbers involved are too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.\r\n\r\nWhere the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual\u2019s identity could be revealed, some other figures have also been excluded.
