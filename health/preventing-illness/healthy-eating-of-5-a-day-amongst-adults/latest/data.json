{"guid": "DH014", "title": "Healthy eating of '5-a-day' among adults", "measure_summary": "This data provides an estimate of the percentage of adults (aged 16 and older) in England who ate the recommended 5 portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (\u20185-a-day\u2019) in 2014 and 2015. The results are broken down by ethnicity.\r\n\r\nThe data source is Sport England\u2019s Active People Survey, which from 2014 included new questions on how many portions of fruit and vegetables respondents ate the previous day. \r\n\r\nThe 5-a-day recommendation was issued by the National Health Service in 2002.", "summary": "* in England, more than half of adults ate 5 or more portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (\u20185-a-day\u2019) in 2015\r\n\r\n* the percentage of adults eating 5-a-day fell by 1.2 percentage points between 2014 and 2015  \r\n\r\n* just over a third of Black adults ate 5-a-day in 2015, significantly lower than the proportion of White adults who ate 5-a-day\r\n\r\n* the percentage of adults in the Asian, Chinese and Other ethnic groups who ate 5-a-day in 2015 was also lower than the percentage of White adults doing so", "geographic_coverage": "England", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2014 and 2015", "need_to_know": "It is unlikely that everyone who responded in the Active People Survey (APS) that they eat 5 portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (\u20185-a-day\u2019) responded accurately. This may be because of factors such as social stigma that some people attach to eating behaviours.\r\n\r\nFruit and vegetable consumption are also measured by the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) and the Health Survey for England (HSE). The APS is used for this measure because it has a larger sample size than either the NDNS or HSE, allowing the data to be broken down into more specific ethnic categories.\r\n\r\nWhen compared with the findings from these other surveys, the APS estimates a higher percentage of people eating 5-a-day. This is found for all ethnic groups except Asians where the APS estimates a lower consumption of 5-a-day than the other surveys. These differences may reflect how these surveys collect their data. The APS is a telephone survey whereas the others ask respondents to complete a personal food diary, or use a face-to-face interview. The APS measure is more simplistic, recording only whole numbers of portions and offering no explanation of portion size, for example. Also, the APS measure does not include the consumption of pulses. This may have an impact on its estimates for Asian people in particular, who tend to have a diet rich in pulses.\r\n\r\nThe APS is a \u2018sample survey\u2019: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings\u2019) about the total population. \r\n\r\nAs with all surveys, the estimates from the APS are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.\r\n\r\nThe commentary for this data only includes reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "For this data, the number of people surveyed (the \u2018sample size\u2019) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about specific ethnic categories.

It provides details of how participation varies from place to place and between different groups in the population. It was carried out on behalf of Sport England.", "methodology": "The data for this measure is taken from the Active People Survey (APS) in 2014 and 2015. \r\n\r\nRespondents to the survey were asked 2 questions about how many portions of fruit and vegetables they eat on a usual day. Respondents were counted as eating 5 portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (\u20185-a-day\u2019) if their responses on the numbers of fruit and vegetables added up to 5 or more. \r\n\r\nThe survey was conducted by telephone, using landline numbers selected from a database of randomly generated numbers in Great Britain. Only people aged 16 or older were interviewed. Calls were made throughout the year and at different times each day. A high quality random sampling survey design ensures results are representative of the population. Results for 2015 are based on responses from a sample of approximately 170,000 people, with about 159,000 people answering the questions on eating fruits and vegetables in 2014, and 164,000 people in 2015.\r\n\r\nWeighting \r\n\r\nSurveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (to reach 'findings\u2019) about everyone within that population.\r\n \r\nFor those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.\r\n\r\nWhere this isn\u2019t the case (because some people haven\u2019t responded, for example) analysts use statistical tools to \u2018weight\u2019 the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately. They can then be used to reach meaningful conclusions. \r\n\r\nThe APS data is weighted to reflect the size and composition of the general population by using the most up-to-date official population data. \r\n\r\nConfidence intervals\r\n\r\nThe confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the \u2018download the data\u2019 section. \r\n\r\n52.3% of adults surveyed in 2015 reported eating 5 or more portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (\u20185-a-day\u2019). This is a reliable estimate of the percentage of adults in England who ate 5-a-day, but because the APS results are based on a random sample of adults aged 16 or older, it\u2019s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage.\r\n \r\nIt\u2019s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 52.1% and 52.5% of all adults in England ate 5-a-day in 2015. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall in this range (ie between the upper and lower confidence interval). But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.\r\n\r\nThe smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, the number of Chinese people sampled for this survey is relatively small compared with the entire population, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty for Chinese people is expressed by the wider confidence interval of between 46.0% and 53.3%.\r\n\r\nStatistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with the England value.\r\n\r\nThe Normal Approximation method for calculating confidence intervals has been used. \r\n\r\nFor further details of
