        It is unlikely that everyone who responded in the Active People Survey (APS) that they eat 5 portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (‘5-a-day’) responded accurately. This may be because of factors such as people being unable to accurately recall what they ate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fruit and vegetable consumption is also measured by the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) and the Health Survey for England (HSE). The APS is used for this measure because its data can be broken down into more specific categories than the data from the HSE.
       </p>
       <p>
        When compared with the findings from these other surveys, the APS estimates a higher percentage of people eating 5-a-day. This is found for all ethnic groups except Asians, where the APS estimates a lower consumption of 5-a-day than the other surveys.
       </p>
       <p>
        Differences between the APS and other surveys may be a reflection of how the data is collected. The APS is a telephone survey whereas the others ask respondents to complete a personal food diary, or use a face-to-face interview. The APS measure is more simplistic, recording only whole numbers of portions and offering no explanation of portion size, for example. Also, the APS measure does not include the consumption of pulses. This may have an impact on its estimates for Asian people in particular, who tend to have a diet rich in pulses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The APS is a ‘sample survey’: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about the total population.
       </p>
       <p>
        As with all surveys, the estimates from the APS are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.

       This data shows that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        in England, over half (52.3%) of adults ate 5 or more portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (‘5-a-day’) in 2015
       </li>
       <li>
        the percentage of adults eating 5-a-day fell from 53.5% in 2014 to 52.3% in 2015 (a drop of 1.2 percentage points)
       </li>
       <li>
        53.9% of White adults ate 5-a-day in 2015, a higher percentage than the England average of 52.3%
       </li>
       <li>
        36.4% of Black adults ate 5-a-day in 2015, lower than the percentage of White adults who ate 5-a-day
       </li>
       <li>
        the percentage of adults eating 5-a-day in 2015 was also lower in the Asian, Chinese and Other ethnic groups – at 40.0%, 49.6% and 46.7% respectively – than the percentage of White adults who ate 5-a-day
       </li>
       <li>
        the percentage of adults in the White ethnic group who ate 5-a-day decreased between 2014 and 2015, but there were no conclusive differences for other ethnic groups over this period

         Purpose of data source
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Active People Survey (APS) was used to measure the number of adults taking part in sport and active recreation across England. It provides details of how participation varies from place to place and between different groups in the population. It was carried out on behalf of Sport England.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Methodology
        </h3>
        <p>
         The data for this measure is taken from the Active People Survey (APS) in 2014 and 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
         Respondents to the survey were asked 2 questions about how many portions of fruit and vegetables they eat on a usual day. Respondents were counted as eating 5 portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (‘5-a-day’) if their responses on the numbers of fruit and vegetables added up to 5 or more.
        </p>
        <p>
         The survey was conducted by telephone, using landline numbers selected from a database of randomly generated numbers in England, Wales and Scotland. Only people aged 16 or older were interviewed. Calls were made throughout the year and at different times each day. A high quality random sampling survey design ensured results were representative of the population. Results for 2015 were based on responses from a sample of approximately 170,000 people, with about 159,000 people answering the questions on eating fruits and vegetables in 2014, and 164,000 people in 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
         Weighting
        </p>
        <p>
         Surveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (to reach 'findings’) about everyone within that population.
        </p>
        <p>
         For those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where this isn’t the case (because some people haven’t responded, for example) analysts use statistical tools to ‘weight’ the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately. They can then be used to reach meaningful conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The APS data is weighted to reflect the size and composition of the general population by using the most up-to-date official population data.
        </p>
        <p>
         Confidence intervals
        </p>
        <p>
         The confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in
         <a href="#download-the-data">
          Download the data
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         52.3% of adults surveyed in 2015 reported eating 5 or more portions of fruit and vegetables on a usual day (‘5-a-day’). This is a reliable estimate of the percentage of adults in England who ate 5-a-day, but because the APS results are based on a random sample of people aged 16 or older, it’s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage.
        </p>
        <p>
         It’s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 52.1% and 52.5% of all adults in England ate 5-a-day in 2015. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall in this range (ie between the upper and lower confidence interval). But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.
        </p>
        <p>
         The smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, the number of Chinese people sampled for this survey is relatively small compared with the entire population, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty for Chinese people is expressed by the wider confidence interval of between 46.0% and 53.3%.
        </p>
        <p>
         Statistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap when comparing with another ethnic group or between time periods.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Normal Approximation method for calculating confidence intervals has been used.
