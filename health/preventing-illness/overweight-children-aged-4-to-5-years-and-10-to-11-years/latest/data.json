This analysis is based only on children in state-maintained schools that participated in the programme. \r\n\r\nThe NCMP uses a child\u2019s body mass index reference to determine if a child is overweight or obese. For more information on the NCMP and how the programme determines if a child is overweight or obese, see the [NCMP website](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/ncmp).\r\n\r\nChildren aren\u2019t required to participate in the programme, but if they don\u2019t want to they need to opt out. In 2015/16 there were 1,170,000 participants, with only 5% of pupils opting out. \r\n\r\nConfidence intervals\r\n\r\nThe confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the \u2018download the data\u2019 section. \r\n\r\nBased on the NCMP measurements, it\u2019s estimated that 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 were overweight in England in 2015/16.\r\n\r\nThe NCMP is based on a sample of schoolchildren aged 4 to 5 and aged 10 to 11 in state-maintained schools, rather than all schoolchildren of those ages in such schools in England. This measure makes a reliable estimate of the percentage of children of these ages in England who are overweight, but it\u2019s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 22.0% and 22.2% of all 4 to 5 year olds were overweight in 2015/16. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.\r\n\r\nThe smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer children from the Chinese ethnic group responded to the survey than White children, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 15.6% and 18.6% for Chinese children aged 4 to 5 in 2015/16.\r\n\r\nStatistically significant findings have
