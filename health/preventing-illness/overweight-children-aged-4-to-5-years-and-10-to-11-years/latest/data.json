The Health Survey for England (HSE) found that among boys and girls aged 2 to 15, the proportion of children who were classified as obese increased from 11.7 per cent in 1995 to 16.0 per cent in 2010, peaking at 18.9 per cent in 2004.\r\n\r\nThere is concern about the rise of childhood obesity and the implications of such obesity persisting into adulthood. The risk of obesity in adulthood and risk of future obesity-related ill health are greater as children get older. Studies tracking child obesity into adulthood have found that the probability of overweight and obese children becoming overweight or obese adults increases with age1,2,3. The health consequences of childhood obesity include: increased blood lipids, glucose intolerance, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, increases in liver enzymes associated with fatty liver, exacerbation of conditions such as asthma and psychological problems such as social isolation, low self-esteem, teasing and bullying.\r\n\r\nThe National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence have produced guidelines to tackle obesity in adults and children - Obesity: the prevention, identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children.

The programme was launched in 2005/06. Height and weight measurements are collected from children in reception (aged 4-5 years) and year 6 (aged 10-11 years) primarily in state-maintained schools in England.\r\nParticipation in the programme is not compulsory, but non-participation is on an opt-out basis only. In 2015/16, a participation rate of 95% was acheived (1,170,000 records). Further details on data quality can be found in the NCMP 2015/16 data quality statement: http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB22269/nati-chil-meas-prog-eng-2015-2016-qual.pdf\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the effect of natural variation, confidence intervals are calculated around prevalence estimates and these should be considered when interpreting results. A confidence interval gives an indication of the sampling error around the estimate calculated and takes into consideration the sample sizes and the degree of variation in the data. They are used to determine whether any differences in the prevalence figures are likely to be real or due to natural variation. Confidence intervals were applied using the Wilson score method and 95% significance have been applied.\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Score method1 gives very accurate approximate confidence intervals for proportions and odds based on the assumption of a Binomial distribution. It can be used with any data values, even when the denominator is very small and, unlike some methods, it does not fail to give an interval when the numerator count, and therefore the proportion, is zero. The Wilson Score method is the preferred method for calculating confidence intervals for proportions and odds, but it can also be used for rates, as long as the event rate is low (relatively rare events within the population) as the Binomial distribution is a very good approximation to the Poisson distribution when the event rate is low. The method is described in detail in APHO Technical Briefing 3: Commonly used public health statistics and their confidence intervals.2\r\n\r\nStatistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with England value.\r\n\r\n1 Wilson EB.

This analysis is based only on children in state-maintained schools that participated in the programme. \r\n\r\nThe NCMP uses a child\u2019s body mass index reference to determine if a child is overweight or obese. For more information on the NCMP and how the programme determines if a child is overweight or obese, see the [NCMP website](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/ncmp).\r\n\r\nChildren aren\u2019t required to participate in the programme, but if they don\u2019t want to they need to opt out. In 2015/16 there were 1,170,000 participants, with only 5% of pupils opting out. Further details on data quality can be found in the [NCMP 2016/16 data quality statement](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB22269/nati-chil-meas-prog-eng-2015-2016-qual.pdf).\r\n\r\n\r\nConfidence intervals\r\nConfidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the \u2018download the data\u2019 section and also available from the CSV downloads for \u2018Overweight or obese children by ethnicity\u2019. \r\n\r\nBased on the NCMP measurements, it\u2019s estimated that 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 were overweight or obese in England in 2015/16.\r\n\r\nThe NCMP is based on a sample of schoolchildren aged 4 to 5 and aged 10 to 11 in state-maintained schools, rather than all schoolchildren of those ages in such schools in England. This measure makes a reliable estimate of the percentage of children of these ages in England who are overweight or obese, but it\u2019s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 22.0% and 22.2% of all 4 to 5 year olds were overweight or obese in 2015/16. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.\r\n\r\nThe smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer children from the Chinese ethnic group responded to the survey than White children, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 15.6% and 18.6% for Chinese children aged 4 to 5 in 2015/16.\r\n\r\nStatistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with the England value.", "data_type": "Administrative data", "suppression_rules": "England totals include all children in state-maintained schools, with a valid height and weight measurement, including those with an unknown residency.\r\n", "disclosure_control": "", "estimation": "Unrounded", "type_of_statistic": "Official statistic", "qmi_url": "", "further_technical_information": "http://content.digital.nhs.uk/ncmp\r\nhttp://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160805121933/http://www.noo.org.uk/NCMP\r\nhttp://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=23381&q=national+child+measurement+programme&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1#top", "dimensions": [{"guid": "9907079e7f14b72ae2d5f191b98b9c35f3ef66e3", "title": "Overweight or obese children by ethnicity ", "measure": "DH001", "time_period": "2015/16", "summary": "* the percentage of children aged 4 to 5 who were overweight or obese was significantly lower than the 22.1% national average in the following ethnic groups: Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Any other Asian background, Any other White background, Mixed White and Asian, Chinese\r\n\r\n* the percentage of children aged 10 to 11 who were overweight or obese was significantly lower than the 34.2% national average in the following ethnic groups: White and Asian mixed, Chinese, and White British\r\n\r\n* in both age groups, Black African children were the most likely to be overweight or obese in 2015/16, with almost a third (31.2%) of the younger group and nearly half the older group (45.9%) overweight or obese\r\n\r\n* among children aged 10 to 11, children from the Mixed White/Asian ethnic group were least likely to be overweight or obese (30.1% were in 2015/16)\r\n\r\n* among 4 to 5 year olds, 14.5% of Indian children were overweight or obese, the lowest percentage of any ethnic group\r\n\r\n* however, among 10 to 11 year olds, 36.3% of Indian children were overweight or obese, higher than the England average and the largest increase between age groups of any ethnic group\r\n\r\n* for other Asian groups (aside from Chinese) the proportion of children aged 10 to 11 who were overweight or obese was about twice that of children aged 4 to 5", "chart": {"type": "bar", "title": {"text": "Percentage of 4 to 5 year olds and 10 to 11 year olds who were overweight or obese by ethnicity in 2015/16"}, "xAxis": {"title": {"text": ""}, "categories": ["Bangladeshi", "Chinese", "Indian", "Pakistani", "Asian other", "Black african", "Black caribbean", "Black other", "Mixed White/Asian", "Mixed White/Black african", "Mixed White/Black caribbean", "Mixed other", "White British", "White Irish", "White other", "Any other", "All"]}, "yAxis": {"title": {"text": ""}}, "series": [{"name": "4-5 yrs", "data": [{"y": 20.3, "category": "Bangladeshi"}, {"y": 17.1, "category": "Chinese"}, {"y": 14.5, "category": "Indian"}, {"y": 19.2, "category": "Pakistani"}, {"y": 19.6, "category": "Asian other"}, {"y": 31.2, "category": "Black african"}, {"y": 25.2, "category": "Black caribbean"}, {"y": 28.4, "category": "Black other"}, {"y": 16.2, "category": "Mixed White/Asian"}, {"y": 26.7, "category": "Mixed White/Black african"}, {"y": 24.9, "category": "Mixed White/Black caribbean"}, {"y": 22, "category": "Mixed other"}, {"y": 22.4, "category": "White British"}, {"y": 24.7, "category": "White Irish"}, {"y": 20.4, "category": "White other"}, {"y": 23.8, "category": "Any other"}, {"y": 22.1, "category": "All"}], "name_value": 4}, {"name": "10-11 yrs", "data": [{"y": 42.7, "category": "Bangladeshi"}, {"y": 30.2, "category": "Chinese"}, {"y": 36.3, "category": "Indian"}, {"y": 40.6, "category": "Pakistani"}, {"y": 38.2, "category": "Asian other"}, {"y": 45.9, "category": "Black african"}, {"y": 45.3, "category": "Black caribbean"}, {"y": 41.6, "category": "Black other"}, {"y": 30.1, "category": "Mixed White/Asian"}, {"y": 40.3, "category": "Mixed White/Black african"}, {"y": 39.4, "category": "Mixed White/Black caribbean"}, {"y": 36.7, "category": "Mixed other"}, {"y": 31.9, "category": "White British"}, {"y": 32.8, "category": "White Irish"}, {"y": 36.2, "category": "White other"}, {"y": 40.6, "category": "Any other"}, {"y": 34.2, "category": "All"}], "name_value": 10}], "number_format": {"multiplier": 1, "prefix": "", "suffix": "%", "min": 0, "max": 100}, "chart": {"type": "bar"}}, "table": {"group_columns": ["", "2014/15", "2015/16"], "type": "grouped", "category": "Ethnicity", "columns": ["% obese/overweight 4 to 5 year olds", "% obese/overweight 10 to 11 year olds"], "data": [{"category": "White -
