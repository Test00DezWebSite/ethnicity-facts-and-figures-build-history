      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         in 2015/16, an estimated 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 in England were overweight or obese
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         for children aged 4 to 5, this was an increase from 21.9% in 2014/15

       <li>

       <li>
        <p>
         in both the 4 to 5 and the 10 to 11 age groups, Black African children were the most likely to be overweight or obese in 2015/16, with almost a third (31.2%) of the younger group and nearly half (45.9%) of the older group overweight or obese
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         in 2015/16, Black African children aged 4 to 5 were more than twice as likely to be overweight or obese compared to Indian children, of whom 14.5% were overweight or obese
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         among children aged 10 to 11, children from the White and Asian mixed ethnic group were least likely to be overweight or obese (30.1%) in 2015/16, followed by Chinese children (30.2%)

        As with any data source, errors may have been made when collecting, preparing or interpreting the data. Some overweight children may be more likely to opt out of participating in the NCMP than children who are not overweight or obese.

        When observing trends in these statistics, do not infer the existence or absence of trends outside the time period covered by this measure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The data collected through the NCMP is used to make generalisations about the total population. As with any sample used to make observations on the total population, the estimates statisticians make are subject to a degree of uncertainty. The degree of uncertainty is greater for a group in which the number of participants is small, so it will be highest for minority ethnic groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        The differences between ethnic groups in the percentage of children who are overweight that were observed and reported on here were larger than any uncertainty around the estimates (they were ‘statistically significant’).
       </p>
       <p>
        The data presented here only includes children who participated in the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in state-maintained schools. Any measurements taken at independent or special schools are excluded from this analysis.

        This data measures the percentage of children who are overweight or obese in 2 age groups – reception year (4 to 5 years old) and year 6 (10 to 11 years old). The data covers children in state-maintained schools but not those in independent or special schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Estimates are based on measurements of children in the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in participating state-maintained schools in England in academic years 2014/15 to 2015/16. The data is collected to help support local health initiatives and services for children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defining a child as overweight or obese is a complex process because a child’s weight and height change at the same time as they grow. For information on that process see the Methodology section.

         Purpose Of Data Source
        </h3>
        <p>
         The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) measures the height and weight of children in reception class (aged 4 to 5 years) and year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) to assess overweight and obesity levels in children within primary schools. This data can be used at a national level to support local public health initiatives and inform the local planning and delivery of services for children.
        </p>
        <p>
         The programme is recognised internationally as a world-class source of public health intelligence and holds UK National Statistics status.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NCMP was set up in line with the Government's strategy to tackle obesity and to:
'-inform local planning and delivery of services for children
-gather population-level data to allow analysis of trends in growth patterns and obesity
-increase public and professional understanding of weight issues in children and be a vehicle for engaging with children and families about healthy lifestyles and weight issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         The UK is experiencing an epidemic of obesity affecting both adults and children. The Health Survey for England (HSE) found that among boys and girls aged 2 to 15, the proportion of children who were classified as obese increased from 11.7 per cent in 1995 to 16.0 per cent in 2010, peaking at 18.9 per cent in 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is concern about the rise of childhood obesity and the implications of such obesity persisting into adulthood. The risk of obesity in adulthood and risk of future obesity-related ill health are greater as children get older. Studies tracking child obesity into adulthood have found that the probability of overweight and obese children becoming overweight or obese adults increases with age1,2,3. The health consequences of childhood obesity include: increased blood lipids, glucose intolerance, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, increases in liver enzymes associated with fatty liver, exacerbation of conditions such as asthma and psychological problems such as social isolation, low self-esteem, teasing and bullying.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence have produced guidelines to tackle obesity in adults and children - Obesity: the prevention, identification, assessment and management of overweight and obesity in adults and children. Available at http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG43.

The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) annually measures over one million children and provides robust data on rates of childhood obesity during an academic year. The programme was launched in 2005/06. Height and weight measurements are collected from children in reception (aged 4-5 years) and year 6 (aged 10-11 years) primarily in state-maintained schools in England.
Participation in the programme is not compulsory, but non-participation is on an opt-out basis only. In 2015/16, a participation rate of 95% was acheived (1,170,000 records). Further details on data quality can be found in the NCMP 2015/16 data quality statement: http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB22269/nati-chil-meas-prog-eng-2015-2016-qual.pdf

         In recognition of the effect of natural variation, confidence intervals are calculated around prevalence estimates and these should be considered when interpreting results. A confidence interval gives an indication of the sampling error around the estimate calculated and takes into consideration the sample sizes and the degree of variation in the data. They are used to determine whether any differences in the prevalence figures are likely to be real or due to natural variation. Confidence intervals were applied using the Wilson score method and 95% significance have been applied.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Wilson Score method1 gives very accurate approximate confidence intervals for proportions and odds based on the assumption of a Binomial distribution. It can be used with any data values, even when the denominator is very small and, unlike some methods, it does not fail to give an interval when the numerator count, and therefore the proportion, is zero. The Wilson Score method is the preferred method for calculating confidence intervals for proportions and odds, but it can also be used for rates, as long as the event rate is low (relatively rare events within the population) as the Binomial distribution is a very good approximation to the Poisson distribution when the event rate is low. The method is described in detail in APHO Technical Briefing 3: Commonly used public health statistics and their confidence intervals.2
        </p>
        <p>
         Statistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with England value.

         Methodology
        </h3>
        <p>
         Launched in 2005/06, the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) measures over one million children each year and is a valuable source of data on childhood obesity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Measurements of height and weight are collected from children in reception (ages 4 to 5) and year 6 (ages 10 to 11), primarily in state-maintained schools in England. This analysis is based only on children in state-maintained schools that participated in the programme.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NCMP uses a child’s body mass index reference to determine if a child is overweight or obese. For more information on the NCMP and how the programme determines if a child is overweight or obese, see the
         <a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/ncmp">
          NCMP website
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Children aren’t required to participate in the programme, but if they don’t want to they need to opt out. In 2015/16 there were 1,170,000 participants, with only 5% of pupils opting out. Further details on data quality can be found in the
         <a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB22269/nati-chil-meas-prog-eng-2015-2016-qual.pdf">
          NCMP 2016/16 data quality statement
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Confidence intervals
Confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the ‘download the data’ section and also available from the CSV downloads for ‘Overweight or obese children by ethnicity’.
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on the NCMP measurements, it’s estimated that 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 were overweight or obese in England in 2015/16.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NCMP is based on a sample of schoolchildren aged 4 to 5 and aged 10 to 11 in state-maintained schools, rather than all schoolchildren of those ages in such schools in England. This measure makes a reliable estimate of the percentage of children of these ages in England who are overweight or obese, but it’s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage.
        </p>
        <p>
         It’s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 22.0% and 22.2% of all 4 to 5 year olds were overweight or obese in 2015/16. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.
        </p>
        <p>
         The smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer children from the Chinese ethnic group responded to the survey than White children, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 15.6% and 18.6% for Chinese children aged 4 to 5 in 2015/16.
        </p>
        <p>
         Statistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with the England value.
