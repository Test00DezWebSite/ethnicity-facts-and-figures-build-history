        <p>
         in England, the percentage of new cancer diagnoses at stage 1 or 2 increased significantly from 50.7% in 2014 to 52.4% in 2015

        The statistics here are called ‘experimental’ because of the variation in data quality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Improvements in the early diagnosis of cancers as shown here between 2014 and 2015 partly reflect real improvements in the early diagnosis of cancers. However, they mostly reflect improvements in data quality. This is because the extent of recording data about cancer stages when making diagnoses has improved considerably between 2012 and 2015, but still varies. You should therefore use caution when interpreting the data.
       </p>
       <p>
        When new cancers are diagnosed but the stage is not recorded, the resulting statistics will show a low percentage of all cases diagnosed at stage 1 or 2. If more cases of cancer are identified by stage, the percentage of early stage cancers will tend to increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steps are taken to exclude data where it is not robust enough to produce a meaningful indicator. Data is excluded from those areas where information is available on the stage of cancer for fewer than 70% of cases diagnosed with a cancer covered by these statistics.
       </p>
       <p>
        The particular types of cancers diagnosed will also impact on the percentage of early stage cancers diagnosed. For example, breast cancer is far more likely to be diagnosed at an early stage than lung cancer.

        ‘Staging’ is a way of describing the size of a cancer and how far it has grown. ‘Early stage’ in these statistics mean the cancer was diagnosed at stage 1 or stage 2.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stage 1 usually means that a cancer is relatively small and contained within the organ it started in. Stage 2 usually means the cancer has not begun to spread into surrounding tissue but that the tumour is larger than in stage 1.
       </p>
       <p>
        These statistics show the crude percentage of cancers of a particular type that were diagnosed at early stages. The crude percentage is calculated as the number of these new cancer cases diagnosed at stage 1 and 2 in each area of England divided by the total number of these new cancer cases in the same area and multiplied by 100.

       <p>
        in England, the percentage of new cancer diagnoses at stage 1 or 2 increased significantly from 50.7% in 2014 to 52.4% in 2015
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        in 2015, Chinese people had the highest percentage of cancers diagnosed at stage 1 or 2 (56.2%), although this was not significantly higher than the average for all ethnic groups in England
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        in 2015, the Other ethnic group and those whose ethnicity was unknown had a lower percentage of people being diagnosed with early stage cancer than the average across England, at 50.2% and 50.3%, respectively; for those whose ethnicity was unknown, this was significantly lower than the average

      <li>
       <p>
        the percentage of new cancer diagnoses at an early stage increased in all ethnic groups between 2014 and 2015; the increase was statistically significant for White people and where the ethnic group was unknown

         Purpose of data source
        </h3>
        <p>
         Cancer is a major cause of death, accounting for around a quarter of deaths in England. More than 1 in 3 people will develop cancer at some point in their life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Diagnosis at an early stage of the cancer’s development leads to improved survival chances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Specific public health interventions, such as screening programmes and information/education campaigns, aim to improve rates of early diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The percentage of cancers diagnosed at an early stage is therefore a useful way of assessing improvements in cancer survival rates.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Methodology
        </h3>
        <p>
         A range of healthcare providers and other services (for example, pathology laboratories) submit cancer incidence data for England (that is, the number of people diagnosed with cancer over time) to the regional offices of the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), which is part of Public Health England.
        </p>
        <p>
         The quality and accuracy of the data submitted by different sources may vary. The regional offices of NCRAS collate all the data for each patient, including checks for internal consistency of the sequence of dates, as well as which part of the body the cancer affects, its morphology and the patient’s sex. NCRAS also checks for duplicate registrations.
        </p>
        <p>
         In recognition of the effect of natural variation, 95% confidence intervals are calculated around estimates for new cancer diagnoses at an early stage and these should be considered when interpreting results.
        </p>
        <p>
         A confidence interval gives an indication of the sampling error around the estimate calculated. It takes into consideration the sample sizes and the degree of variation in the data. Confidence intervals are used to determine whether any differences in the figures are likely to be real or due to natural variation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In statistical terms, a 95% confidence interval means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall in this range (that is, between the upper and lower confidence interval). But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.
        </p>
        <p>
         The width of the confidence interval varies with the number of cancer diagnoses upon which it is based. The smaller the number, the wider the confidence interval, because less data means greater uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Therefore, for the White ethnic group, which has the largest number of new diagnoses, the confidence intervals range from 52.2% to 52.7% in 2015. For the Chinese group, which has the smallest number, the confidence intervals range from 51.3% to 61.0%.
        </p>
        <p>
         Statistically significant findings (that is, findings that suggest that the percentage of cancers being diagnosed at an early stage is significantly different from the average) have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with the value for all ethnicities in England of 52.4%.
