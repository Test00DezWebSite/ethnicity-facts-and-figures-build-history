{"guid": "DH 020", "title": "Illicit drug use among adults", "measure_summary": "This data measures the percentage of adults (aged 16 and older) in England who used illicit drugs in the 12 months prior to the survey. The data source is the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) that was conducted in private households across England in 2014. \r\n\r\nDrug misuse is defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the use of a substance for a purpose not consistent with legal or medical guidelines. An example would be the non-medical use of prescription medications or the recreational use of illegal drugs.\r\n\r\nThose surveyed were asked if they had, within the past year, used one of 15 types of named drugs: cannabis, amphetamines, amyl nitrite (poppers), anabolic steroids, cocaine, crack, ecstasy, heroin, ketamine, mephedrone, LSD, magic mushrooms, methadone, tranquilisers, and inhalants (volatile substances such as glue, gas, aerosols or solvents). The drugs asked about are those considered to be mostly widely used. \r\n\r\nA range of new psychoactive substances (NPS) has entered the drugs market but were not assessed in this survey. Uncertainty over their content and rapid changes in what is available makes measuring the use of these substances in surveys extremely challenging.\r\n", "summary": "* Black adults were nearly 3 and a half times as likely as Asian adults to have used illicit drugs in the 12 months prior to the survey\r\n\r\n* Black women were nearly 25 times as likely as Asian women to have used illicit drugs in the 12 months prior to the survey\r\n\r\n* there were no other meaningful differences between ethnic groups in the use of illicit drugs (although the graph shows a difference between other ethnic groups in terms of drug use, any generalisations based on these results are very unreliable)\r\n", "geographic_coverage": "England", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2014", "need_to_know": "The survey covers adults aged 16 or over who live in private households. A household survey that measures drug use and dependence won\u2019t include several groups in which drug use occurs. These include students in halls of residence, the homeless, and those living in institutional settings such as hospitals and prisons. Some drug users living in private households may also be less likely to participate in surveys, as they may lead chaotic lives that make them less available, able or willing to answer survey questions. There were 7,528 respondents to the survey. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for minority ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nThe ethnic groupings used here are broad; there is no breakdown of data for the more specific ethnic groups each contains. Some of the specific ethnic groups have very different experiences to one another. For example, the Black/Black British group could include both recent migrants from Somalia and Black people born in Britain to British parents. \r\n", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "For this data, the number of people surveyed (the \u2018sample size\u2019) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about detailed ethnic categories.

They covered lifetime experience of 15 types of named drug, together with use in the past year. The drugs asked about are those considered to be mostly widely used. New psychoactive substances (NPS) were not included.\r\n\r\nEach survey involved interviewing a large stratified probability sample of the general population, covering people living in private households. The full adult age range was covered, with the youngest participants aged 16 and the oldest over 100. \r\n\r\nThe resulting statistics for illicit drug use have been age-standardised. This is because the prevalence of use of illicit drugs is related to age and the age profile (the number of people of different ages within an ethnic group) can differ considerably between ethnic groups. This adjustment allows comparisons to be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe survey covers people who live in private households. It doesn\u2019t include those who live in institutional settings or in temporary housing (such as hostels or bed and breakfasts) or those who sleep rough. \r\n\r\nWhere a selected participant could not take part in a long interview due to a physical or mental health condition, some information about this was recorded by the interviewer on the doorstep. This information may be biased due to it having been collected from another household member.\r\n\r\nSocially undesirable or stigmatised feelings and behaviours may be underreported. While this is a risk for any study based on self-report data, the study goes some way to minimising this by collecting particularly sensitive information in a self-completion format.\r\n\r\nSome people selected for the survey could not be contacted or refused to take part. The achieved response rate (57%) is in line with that of similar surveys (Barnes et al. 2010; cited in APMS 2014). Weighting helps take account of those who were selected for the survey but didn\u2019t take part.\r\n\r\nWeighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy. For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female. \r\n\r\nMore detailed information on the weighting used here can be found on page 24 of the Methods chapter of the [Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2014](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21748/apms-2014-methods.pdf).\r\n\r\nConfidence intervals\r\nThe confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the \u2018download the data\u2019 section and also available from the CSV downloads for \u2018Percentage of adults who used illicit drugs in England in 2013/14 by ethnicity and sex\u2019. \r\n\r\n6.2% of White British women surveyed used illicit drugs in the 12 months prior to the survey. This is a reliable estimate of the percentage of White British women in England who used illicit drugs in that time period, but because the APMS results are based on a random sample of adults aged 16 or older, it\u2019s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage.\r\n \r\nIt\u2019s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 5.2% and 7.3% of all White British women in England used illicit drugs in the 12 months prior to the survey. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall in this range (ie between the upper and lower confidence interval). But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.\r\n\r\nThe smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer women from the Black/Black British ethnic group were sampled for this survey than British White women, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by the wider confidence interval of between 5.3% and 17.1%.\r\n", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "", "disclosure_control": "Risk to disclosure has been accounted for with limitations of the level of disaggregation, size of category groupings, and the maintaining of large underlying populations for analysis.
