The data source is the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) that was conducted in private households across England in 2014. \r\n\r\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. They may also find sleeping and concentrating difficult. These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person\u2019s day-to-day life.\r\n", "summary": "* there were no meaningful differences between ethnic groups in the percentage of adults screening positive for probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\r\n\r\n* although the table shows differences between groups for screening positive, sample sizes were too small to draw reliable conclusions about these results ", "geographic_coverage": "England", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2014", "need_to_know": "A positive screen for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) indicates that someone is likely to have PTSD, based on symptoms they have described. A full clinical assessment would be needed for diagnosis. The questions in the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (AMPS) are used to estimate how common PTSD is likely to be in the adult population, but they aren\u2019t used as part of any national screening programme in England.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for minority ethnic groups. In this situation, the numbers of respondents in each groups were too small to make any conclusions about differences between them.\r\n\r\nThe survey covers adults aged 16 or older who live in private households. It doesn\u2019t include those who live in institutional settings (such as hospitals or prisons) or in temporary housing (such as hostels or bed and breakfasts) or those who sleep rough. People living in such settings are likely to have worse mental health than those living in private households. There were 7,528 respondents to the survey. \r\n\r\nThese statistics are based on participants\u2019 direct responses (as opposed to someone else filling in the survey). As a result, socially undesirable or stigmatised feelings and behaviours may be under-reported. This is a risk with any survey based on self-reported data. \r\n\r\nThe ethnic groupings used here are broad and there is no breakdown of data for the more specific subgroups each contains. Some of these subgroups have very different experiences to one another. For example, the Black/Black British group could include both recent migrants from Somalia and Black people born in Britain to British parents. \r\n", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "For this data, the number of people surveyed (the \u2018sample size\u2019) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about detailed ethnic categories.

The full adult age range was covered, with the youngest participants aged 16 and the oldest over 100. \r\n\r\nWhile a positive screen for PTSD isn\u2019t a diagnosis, it does suggest the person probably has PTSD and warrants a clinical assessment. The [\u2018Methods\u2019 chapter of the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2014](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21748/apms-2014-methods.pdf) sets out the specific methodology of the PCL-C.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of PTSD is determined here by dividing the number of respondents with a score of 50 or more on the PCL-C by the total number of respondents.\r\n\r\nThe resulting statistics for PTSD have been age-standardised. This is because the prevalence of common mental disorders is related to age and the age profile can differ considerably between ethnic groups. (An age profile shows the number of people of different ages within an ethnic group.) This adjustment allows comparisons to be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe survey covers people who live in private households. It doesn\u2019t include those who live in institutional settings or in temporary housing (such as hostels or bed and breakfasts) or those who sleep rough. People living in such settings are likely to have worse mental health than those living in private households (Gill et al. 1996; cited in APMS 2014).\r\n\r\nWhere a selected participant could not take part in a long interview due to a physical or mental health condition, some information about this was recorded by the interviewer on the doorstep. This information may be biased due to it having been collected from another household member.\r\n\r\nSocially undesirable or stigmatised feelings and behaviours may be underreported. While this is a risk for any study based on self-report data, the study goes some way to minimising this by collecting particularly sensitive information in a self-completion format.\r\n\r\nSome people selected for the survey could not be contacted or refused to take part. The achieved response rate (57%) is in line with that of similar surveys (Barnes et al. 2010; cited in APMS 2014). Weighting helps take account of those who were selected for the survey but didn\u2019t take part.\r\n\r\nWeighting\r\n\r\nStatisticians rebalance or \u2018weight\u2019 the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable. Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same sex, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.\r\n\r\nBiases in sample selection for the phase 1 interviews were addressed through weighting so that the results were representative of the English household population aged 16 and over. Weights for phase 2, the follow-up of some respondents, were calculated through a process of modelling the probability of being selected and responding, then relating the result to the phase 1 weighting figure. \r\n\r\nConfidence intervals\r\n\r\nConfidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the \u2018download the data\u2019 section and also available from the CSV downloads for \u201cAdults screening positive for probable PTSD by ethnicity and sex\u201d. \r\n\r\nBased on survey results, it\u2019s estimated that 4.9% of White British women screened positive for probable PTSD. \r\n \r\nThis estimate is based on a random sample of adults rather than the whole population of England. The measure makes an estimate of the percentage of different groups who would screen positive for probable PTSD, but it\u2019s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 4.1% and 5.9% of all White British women in England would have screened positively for probable PTSD. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.\r\n \r\nThe smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer Black/Black British women responded to the survey than White British women, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 5.6% and 20.3% for Black/Black British women.\r\n \r\nObserved differences are considered statistically significant when the 95% confidence intervals for an ethnic group don't overlap with those of the overall population of England.\r\n", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "Risk to disclosure has been accounted for with limitations of the level of disaggregation, size of category groupings, and the maintaining of large underlying populations for each level.
