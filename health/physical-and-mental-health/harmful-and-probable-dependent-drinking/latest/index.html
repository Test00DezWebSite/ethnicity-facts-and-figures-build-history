        <p>
         no other meaningful differences between other ethnic groups or between sexes was observed in terms of drinking at hazardous, harmful or mildly dependent levels (other observed differences aren’t reliable, most likely because of the small sample sizes involved)

        The survey covers adults aged 16 or over who live in private households. It doesn’t include those who live in institutional settings (such as prisons or hospitals) or in temporary housing (such as hostels or bed and breakfasts) or those who sleep rough. There were 7,528 respondents to the survey.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for minority ethnic groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ethnic groupings used here are broad; there is no breakdown of data for the more specific ethnic groups each contains. Some of the specific ethnic groups have very different experiences to one another. For example, the Black/Black British group could include both recent migrants from Somalia and Black people born in Britain to British parents.

        This data measures the percentage of adults (aged 16 and over) in different broad ethnic groups in England who are drinking at levels which are hazardous, harmful or mildly dependent. The results are broken down by broad ethnic group. The data source is the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) that was conducted in private households across England in 2014.

        Respondents were assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), which asks 10 questions relating to the year before the interview and covering the following areas:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         alcohol consumption (relating to how often a person drinks, how much they drink, and how often they drink heavily)
        </li>
        <li>
         alcohol-related harm (including feelings of guilt or remorse after drinking, blackouts, alcohol-related injury, and other concerns about alcohol consumption)
        </li>
        <li>
         symptoms of alcohol dependence (including a person’s difficulty in controlling how often or how much they drink, an increase in the importance of drinking to them, and morning drinking)
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Answers to all questions are scored from 0 to 4, and added up to give a total score ranging from 0 to 40. An audit score of:

         0 to 7 indicates non-drinker or low risk

        <li>
         8 to 15 indicates hazardous drinking (a less serious problem with alcohol where the person might benefit from advice on ways to drink less)
        </li>
        <li>
         16 to 19 indicates harmful drinking or mild dependence (a more serious problem with alcohol where the person would benefit from professional counselling to reduce alcohol consumption)

         Purpose of data source
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) series provides England's National Statistics for the prevalence of mental illness and treatment access in the adult household population.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Methodology
        </h3>
        <p>
         Each survey involved interviewing a large stratified probability sample of the general population, covering people living in private households. The full adult age range was covered, with the youngest participants aged 16 and the oldest over 100.
        </p>
        <p>
         Initial questions about alcohol consumption were asked by the interviewer face to face. All participants who drank alcohol, even if just occasionally, were then routed to the remaining alcohol use questions. These were administered using computer-assisted self-completion interview (CASI), consistent with the approach used on the 2000 and 2007 surveys.
        </p>
        <p>
         The resulting statistics for problem drinking have been age-standardised. This is because the prevalence of problem drinking is related to age and the age profile (the number of people of different ages within an ethnic group) can differ considerably between ethnic groups. This adjustment allows comparisons to be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile.
        </p>
        <p>
         The survey covers people who live in private households. It doesn’t include those who live in institutional settings or in temporary housing (such as hostels or bed and breakfasts) or those who sleep rough.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where a selected participant could not take part in a long interview due to a physical or mental health condition, some information about this was recorded by the interviewer on the doorstep. This information may be biased due to it having been collected often from another household member.
        </p>
        <p>
         Socially undesirable or stigmatised feelings and behaviours may be underreported. While this is a risk for any study based on self-report data, the study goes some way to minimising this by collecting particularly sensitive information in a self-completion format.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some people selected for the survey could not be contacted or refused to take part. The achieved response rate (57%) is in line with that of similar surveys (Barnes et al. 2010; cited in APMS 2014). Weighting helps take account of those who were selected for the survey but didn’t take part.
        </p>
        <p>
         Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy. For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.
        </p>
        <p>
         More detailed information on the weighting used here can be found on page 24 of the Methods chapter of the
         <a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21748/apms-2014-methods.pdf">
          Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2014
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Confidence Intervals
The confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the ‘download the data’ section and also available from the CSV downloads for ‘Problem drinking in adults.csv’.
        </p>
        <p>
         2.2% of White British adults surveyed were drinking at harmful or mild dependence levels in England 2014. This is a reliable estimate of the percentage of adults who were drinking at this level. However, because the APMS results are based on a random sample of adults aged 16 or older, it is impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 1.8% and 2.7% of all White British adults were drinking at harmful or mild dependence levels. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall in this range (ie between the upper and lower confidence interval). But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.
        </p>
        <p>
         The smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer adults from the Black/Black British ethnic group were sampled for this survey than British White adults, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by the wider confidence interval for harmful or mild dependent drinking of between 0.6% and 3.9%.
