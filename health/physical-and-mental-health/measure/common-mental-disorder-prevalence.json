A diagnosis of common mental disorder (CMD) was made based on the responses. \r\n \r\nThe resulting statistics for CMD have been age-standardised. This is because the prevalence of common mental disorders is related to age and the age profile can differ considerably between ethnic groups. This adjustment allows comparisons to be made between ethnic groups as if they had the same age profile.\r\n \r\nEach survey involved interviewing a large stratified probability sample of the general population, covering people living in private households. The full adult age range was covered, with the youngest participants aged 16 and the oldest over 100. \r\n\r\nThe two-phase survey design involved an initial interview with the whole sample, followed up with a structured assessment carried out by clinically trained interviewers with a subset of participants. People were assessed or screened for a range of different types of mental disorder, from common conditions like depression and anxiety disorder through to rarer neurological and mental conditions such as psychotic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  \r\n\r\nSpecific Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) and symptoms of CMD were assessed in the first phase interview using the Clinical Interview Schedule \u2013 Revised (CIS-R). The CIS-R is an interviewer administered structured interview schedule covering the presence of non-psychotic symptoms in the week prior to interview. It can be used to provide prevalence estimates for 14 types of CMD symptoms and six types of CMD, together with a continuous scale that reflects the overall severity of CMD psychopathology. Each section of the CIS-R assesses one type of CMD symptom.  somatic symptoms, fatigue, concentration and forgetfulness, sleep problems, irritability, depression, depressive ideas, worry, anxiety, phobias, panic, compulsions and obsessions.\r\n\r\nThe participants\u2019 answers to the CIS-R were used to generate 10th International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) diagnoses of CMD. These ICD-10 diagnoses were then amalgamated to produce six categories of disorder: Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), Depression (including mild, moderate and severe), Phobias, Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), Panic disorder and CMD not otherwise specified (CMD-NOS, referred to in previous surveys in the APMS series as \u2018mixed-anxiety and depression\u2019).\r\n\r\nThe sampling frame covers only those living in private households, and therefore those who were living in institutional settings such as large residential care homes, offender institutions, prisons, in temporary housing (such as hostels or bed and breakfasts) or sleeping rough, would not have had a chance to be selected. People living in such settings are likely to have worse mental health than those living in private households (Gill et al. 1996; cited in APMS 2014).\r\n\r\nBiases in sample selection for the phase 1 interviews were addressed through weighting so that the results were representative of the English household population aged 16 and over.\r\n\r\nSome people selected for the survey were not able to take part in a long interview. These include those with serious physical health conditions, who may feel unwell or be staying in hospital during the fieldwork period, and those whose mental capability may be impaired, for example due to cognitive decline as a result of dementia or injury, or because of a learning impairment. Where a selected participant could not take part due to a physical or mental health condition, some information about this was recorded by the interviewer on the doorstep. This information may be biased due to it having been collected often from another household member.\r\n\r\nSome people selected for the survey could not be contacted or refused to take part. The achieved response rate (57%) is in line with that of similar surveys (Barnes et al. 2010; cited in APMS 2014). A problem for all such studies is how to take account of those who do not take part, either because contact could not be established with the selected household or individual or because they refused to take part. The weighting addresses this to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe mental health assessments used are not as reliable as a clinical interview. In a clinical interview, a trained psychologist or psychiatrist may take many sessions and much explorative questioning and clinical judgement to reach a diagnosis. In the context of a questionnaire administered by a lay interviewer, this is not possible. However, the assessments used have been validated and are among the best available for the purpose in hand.\r\n\r\nSocially undesirable or stigmatised feelings and behaviours may be underreported. While this is a risk for any study based on self-report data, the study goes some way to minimising this by collecting particularly sensitive information in a self-completion format.", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "No suppression other than the disclosure control detailed below has been applied.", "disclosure_control": "Risk to disclosure has been accounted for with limitations of the level of disaggregation, size of category groupings, and the maintaining of large underlying populations for each level.
