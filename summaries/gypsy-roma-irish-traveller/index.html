    <p class="govuk-body">This is a summary of statistics about people from the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller ethnic groups
      living in England and Wales.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It is part of a series of <a

    <p class="govuk-body">Gypsy, Roma and Traveller (GRT) is a term used to describe people from a range of ethnicities
      who are believed to face similar challenges. These groups are distinct, but are often reported together.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This page includes:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>information about GRT data and its reliability</li>
      <li>some statistics from the 2011 Census</li>
      <li>other statistics on the experiences of people from the GRT groups in topics including education, housing and
        health</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">This is an overview based on a selection of data published on <a href="/"
         class="govuk-link">Ethnicity facts and figures</a> or analyses of other sources. Some published data (for
      example, on higher education) is only available for the aggregated White ethnic group, and is not included here.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Through this report, we sometimes make comparisons with national averages. While in other
      reports we might compare with another ethnic group (usually White British), we have made this decision here
      because of the relatively small impact the GRT group has on the overall national average.</p>

    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The term Gypsy, Roma and Traveller has been used to describe a range of ethnic groups or
      people with nomadic ways of life who are not from a specific ethnicity.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">In the UK, it is common in data collections to differentiate between:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Gypsies (including English Gypsies, Scottish Gypsies or Travellers, Welsh Gypsies and other Romany people)
      </li>
      <li>Irish Travellers (who have specific Irish roots)</li>
      <li>Roma, understood to be more recent migrants from Central and Eastern Europe</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="govuk-body">The term Traveller can also encompass groups that travel. This includes, but is not limited
      to, New Travellers, Boaters, Bargees and Showpeople. (See the House of Commons Committee report on <a

      <span class="number">3. </span>Classifications
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">For the first time, the 2011 Census ethnic group question included a tick box for the
      ethnic group â€˜Gypsy or Irish Travellerâ€™. This was not intended for people who identify as Roma because they
      are a distinct group with different needs to Gypsy or Irish Travellers.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The 2021 Census had a â€˜Gypsy or Irish Travellerâ€™ category, and a new â€˜Romaâ€™ category.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">A 2018 YouGov poll found that 66% of people in the UK wrongly viewed GRT not to be an
      ethnic group, with <a rel="external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://yjresourcehub.uk/over-representation-and-disproportionality/item/download/929_6a5a2811d4e6a146d93f3e2a3ec46be1.html">many
        mistaking them as a single group</a> (PDF). It is therefore important that GRT communities are categorised
      correctly on data forms, using separate tick boxes when possible to reflect this.</p>

    <p class="
             govuk-body">The 2011 Census figures used in this report and on Ethnicity facts and figures are based on
      respondents who chose to identify with the Gypsy or Irish Traveller ethnic group. People who chose to write
      in Roma as their ethnicity were allocated to the White Other group, and data for them is not included here.
      Other data, such as that from the Department for Education, includes Roma as a category combined with Gypsy,
      with Irish Traveller shown separately.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The commentary in this report uses the specific classifications in each dataset. Users
      should exercise caution when comparing different datasets, for example between education data (which uses
      Gypsy/Roma, and Irish Traveller in 2 separate categories) and the Census (which uses Gypsy and Irish Traveller
      together, but excludes data for people who identify as Roma).</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Finally, it should be noted that there is also a distinction that the government makes, for
      the purposes of planning policy, between those who travel and the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller ethnicities. The
      Department for Communities and
      Local Government (at the time, now the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) <a rel="external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/457420/Final_planning_and_travellers_policy.pdf">planning
        policy for traveller sites</a> (PDF) defines "gypsies and travellers" as:</p>

    <p class="
             govuk-body">"Persons of nomadic habit of life whatever their race or origin, including such persons who on
      grounds only of their own or their familyâ€™s or dependantsâ€™ educational or health needs or old age have
      ceased to travel temporarily, but excluding members of an organised group of travelling showpeople or circus
      people travelling together as such."</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This definition for planning purposes includes any person with a nomadic habit, whether or
      not they might have identified as Gypsy, Roma or Traveller in a data collection.</p>

        inequalities faced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities</a> noted that there was a lack of data on these
      groups.</p>

    <p class="
             govuk-body">The next section highlights some of the problems associated with collecting data on these
      groups, and what is available. Some of the points made about surveys, sample sizes and administrative data
      are generally applicable to any group with a small population.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Improving data for the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller populations, as well as other
      under-represented groups in the population is part of the <a rel="external"

        response</a> to them. For example, in response to recommendation 3 of the report, ONS, RDU and others will
      "build on existing work and develop new collaborative initiatives and action plans to improve inclusion of
      under-represented population groups in UK data in partnership with others across government and more widely".</p>

    <p class="
             govuk-body">Also, the ONS response to recommendation 4 notes the development of a range of strategies to
      improve the UK data infrastructure and fill data gaps to provide more granular data through new or boosted surveys
      and data linkage. Recommendation 6 notes that research will be undertaken using innovative methods best suited to
      the research question and prospective participants, to understand more about the lived experiences of several
      groups under-represented in UK data and evidence, such as people from Gypsy, Roma and Traveller groups.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="improving-classifications"> <span class="number">4.1 </span>Classifications</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">In some data collections, the option for people to identify as Gypsy, Roma or Traveller is
      not available. Any data grouped to the 5 aggregated ethnic groups does not show the groups separately. Data
      based on the 2001 Census does not show them separately as there was no category for people identifying as
      Gypsy, Roma or Traveller. As part of our Quality Improvement Plan, the Race Disparity Unit (RDU) has committed
      to working with government departments to maintain a harmonised approach to collecting data about Gypsy, Roma
      and Traveller people using the GSS harmonised classification. The harmonised classification is currently based
      on the 2011 Census, and an update is currently being considered by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">In particular, RDU has identified working with DHSC and NHS Digital colleagues as a priority â€“
      the
      NHS classification is based on 2001 Census classifications and does not capture information on any of the GRT
      groups separately (they were categorised as White Other in the 2001 Census). Some of these issues have been
      outlined in the <a rel="external"

        id="census-data"> <span class="number">4.2 </span>Census data</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">A main source of data on the Gypsy and Irish Traveller groups is the 2011 Census.
      This will be replaced by the 2021 Census when results are published by the ONS. The statistics in this
      summary use information from Ethnicity facts and figures and the Census section of ONSâ€™s NOMIS website.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="census-data"> <span class="number">4.3 </span>Survey data</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">It is often difficult to conclude at any one point in time whether a disparity is
      significant for the GRT population, as the population is so small in comparison to other ethnic groups.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Even a large sample survey like the Annual Population Survey (APS) has a small
      number of responses from the Gypsy and Irish Traveller ethnic group each year. Analysis of 3 years of
      combined data for 2016, 2017 and 2018 showed there were 62 people in the sample (out of around 500,000
      sampled cases in total over those 3 years) in England and Wales. Another large survey, the Department
      for Transportâ€™s National Travel Survey, recorded 58 people identifying as Gypsy or Traveller out of
      157,000 people surveyed between 2011 and 2019.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Small sample sizes need not be a barrier to presenting data if confidence intervals
      are provided to help the user. But smaller sample sizes will mean wider confidence intervals, and these
      will provide limited analytical value. For the 2016 to 2018 APS dataset â€“ and using the standard error
      approximation method given in the <a rel="external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/methodologies/labourforcesurveyuserguidance/volume6.pdf">LFS
        User Guide volume 6</a> with a fixed design factor of 1.6 (the formula is 1.6 * âˆšp(1 âˆ’ p)/n where p is the
      proportion in employment and n is the sample size.) â€“ the employment rate of 35% for working age people in the
      Gypsy and Traveller group in England and Wales would be between 16% and 54% (based on a 95% confidence interval).
      This uses the same methodology as the ONSâ€™s <a rel="
                   external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/adhocs/13009samplingvariabilityestimatesforlabourmarketstatusbyethnicity/lfsethnicityciod19od20.xlsx">Sampling
        variability estimates for labour market status by ethnicity</a>.</p>

    <p class="
                   govuk-body">A further reason for smaller sample sizes might be lower response rates. The Women and
      Select Committee report on the <a rel="external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmwomeq/360/full-report.html#heading-8">inequalities
        faced by Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities</a> noted that people in these groups may be reluctant to
      self-identify, even where the option is available to them. This is because Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people might
      mistrust the intent behind data collection.
    </p>

    <p class="
                     govuk-body">The RDU recently published a <a rel="external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ethnicity-data-which-differences-in-ethnic-group-data-are-real">method
        and quality report on working out significant differences</a> between estimates for small groups using different
      analytical techniques.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="administrative-data"> <span class="number">4.4 </span>Administrative data</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">While administrative data does not suffer from the same issues of sampling
      variability, small numbers of respondents can mean that data is either disclosive and needs to be
      suppressed to protect the identity of individuals, or results can fluctuate over time.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">An example of this is the measure of <a class="govuk-link"
         href="/education-skills-and-training/a-levels-apprenticeships-further-education/students-aged-16-to-18-achieving-3-a-grades-or-better-at-a-level/latest">students
        getting 3 A grades or better at A level</a>. In 2019 to 2020, no Irish Traveller students achieved
      this (there were 6 students in the cohort). In 2017 to 2018, 2 out of 7 Irish Traveller students
      achieved 3 A grades, or 28.6% â€“ the highest percentage of all ethnic groups.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Aggregating time periods might help with this, although data collected in
      administrative datasets can change over time to reflect the information that needs to be collected for
      the administrative process. The data collected would not necessarily be governed by trying to maintain a
      consistent time series in the same way that data collected through surveys sometimes are.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="administrative-data"> <span class="number">4.5 </span>Data linkage</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">Linking datasets together provides a way of producing more robust data for the GRT
      groups, or in fact, any ethnic group. This might improve the quality of the ethnicity coding in the
      dataset being analysed if an ethnicity classification that is known to be more reliable is linked from
      another dataset.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Data linkage does not always increase the sample size or the number of records
      available in the dataset to be analysed, but it might do if records that have missing ethnicity are
      replaced by a known ethnicity classification from a linked dataset.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">An example is the linking of the Census data to <a rel="external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to15may2020">Hospital
        Episode Statistics (HES) data and death registrations</a> by the ONS. The ethnicity classifications for GRT
      groups are not included in the HES data, and are not collected in the death registrations process at the moment.
      So this data linking gives a way to provide some information for Gypsy and Irish Travellers and other smaller
      groups. The report with data up to 15 May 2020 noted 16 Gypsy or Irish Traveller deaths from COVID-19.</p>

    <p class="
                   govuk-body">RDU will be working with ONS and others to explore the potential for using data linking
      to get more information for the GRT groups.</p>


    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"
        id="administrative-data"> <span class="number">4.6 </span>Bespoke surveys and sample boosts</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">A country-wide, or even local authority, boost of a sample survey is unlikely to
      make estimates for the GRT groups substantially more robust. This is because of the relatively small
      number in the groups to begin with.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Bespoke surveys can be used to get specific information about these groups. The
      Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities list of traveller sites available through their
      <a rel="external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/traveller-caravan-count">Traveller caravan count statistics</a>
      can help target sampling for surveys, for example. Bespoke surveys might be limited in geographical
      coverage, and more suitable for understanding GRT views in a local area and then developing local policy
      responses. An example of a bespoke survey is the <a rel="
                   external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2020/roma-travellers-survey">Roma and Travellers in 6 countries
        survey</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="
                   govuk-body">Another method that could be useful is snowball sampling. Snowball sampling (or
      chain-referral sampling) is a <a rel="external"
         class="govuk-link"
         href="https://www.questionpro.com/blog/non-probability-sampling/">sampling technique</a> in which the
      respondents have traits that are rare to find. In snowball sampling, existing survey respondents provide referrals
      to recruit further people for the survey, which helps the survey grow larger.</p>

    <p class="
                     govuk-body">There are advantages to snowball sampling. It can target hidden or difficult to reach
      populations. It can be a good way to sample hesitant respondents, as a person might be more likely
      to participate in a survey if they have been referred by a friend or family member. It can also be
      quick and cost effective. Snowball sampling may also be facilitated with a GRT community lead or
      cultural mediator. This would help bridge the gap between the GRT communities and the commissioning
      department to encourage respondent participation.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">However, one statistical disadvantage is that the sampling is non-random. This
      reduces the knowledge of whether the sample is representative, and can invalidate some of the usual
      statistical tests for statistical significance, for example.

      groups.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The Gypsy or Irish Traveller group had the smallest percentage of people in the
      highest socio-economic groups. 2.5% were in the â€˜higher, managerial, administrative, professionalâ€™
      group.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">15.1% of Gypsy or Irish Traveller people were small employers and own account
      workers. These are people who are generally self-employed and have responsibility for a small number of
      workers. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For Gypsy or Irish Travellers, who were 16 and over and in employment, the largest
      group worked in elementary occupations (22%). This can include occupations such as farm workers, process
      plant workers, cleaners, or service staff (for example, bar or cleaning staff). </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">The second highest occupation group was skilled trades (19%), which can include
      farmers, electrical and building trades. The Gypsy or Irish Traveller group had the highest percentage

    <p class="govuk-body">The gender gap in employment rates for the Gypsy or Irish Traveller group aged 16
      and over was nearly twice as large as for all ethnic groups combined. In the Gypsy or Irish Traveller
      ethnic group, 46% of men and 29% of women were employed, a gap of 17%. For all ethnic groups combined,
      64% of men and 54% of women were employed, a gap of 10%.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This is likely to be due to the fact that Gypsy or Irish Traveller women (63%) were
      about 1.5 times as likely as Gypsy or Irish Traveller men (43%) to be economically inactive, which means
      they were out of work and not looking for work.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">There are a range of reasons why people can be economically inactive. The most

      family (27%). This is higher than the average for England and Wales (11%). The second most common reason
      was being long term sick or disabled (26%) â€“ the highest percentage out of all ethnic groups.</p>
