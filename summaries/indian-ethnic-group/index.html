    <p class="govuk-body">This is a summary of statistics about people from the Indian ethnic group (also referred to
      here as â€˜Indian
      peopleâ€™) living in England and Wales.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">It is part of a planned series of summaries about different ethnic groups. The first in the
      series focuses on
      the <a href="/summaries/black-caribbean-ethnic-group"
         class="govuk-link">Black Caribbean ethnic group</a>.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This page includes:</p>

      <li>some population statistics from the most recent Census (2011)</li>
      <li>data on the experiences of people from the Indian ethnic group compared with White British people, in areas
        including education, crime and policing, home ownership and health</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The White British ethnic group is used for most comparisons as it is the largest group, making
      up 80.5% of the
      population of England and Wales in 2011.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This is an overview based on a selection of data published on <a href="/"
         class="govuk-link">Ethnicity facts and figures</a> or being published soon. Some published data (for example,
      on higher education) is only available for the broad Asian ethnic group, and is therefore not included here.</p>
