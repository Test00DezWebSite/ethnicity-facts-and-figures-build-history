            <p>The data collected through the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Claimant Service and Experience Survey is used to make generalisations about the total population.</p>
<p>Keep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. This is because they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p>The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings.</p>
<p>Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and reflect the total population rather than just the survey sample.</p>
<p>Specifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.</p>
<p>The commentary has focused on findings based on subgroups of at least 100 people to ensure that we report reliable findings.</p>
<p>All surveys carry the risk of biased results if some types of people were less likely to respond than others. To compensate for this, the responses to this survey have been weighted so they better reflect characteristics of the target population. For more about weighting, see the 'Methodology' section.</p>
<p>Satisfaction figures are estimates based on respondents who have had recent contact with DWP. This means they may not reflect the whole claimant population. Keep in mind too that percentages may not add up to 100%, due to rounding.</p>

<p>A ‘claimant’ is someone who gets disability benefits, out-of-work benefits or a State Pension.</p>
<p>The DWP Claimant Service and Experience Survey is held every 3 months, and around 15,500 claimants are interviewed each year. They are selected randomly from all claimants who, in the previous 2 to 3 months have had contact with DWP (for example, they may have made a new claim, or have contacted DWP about a change of circumstances for an existing claim).</p>
<p>Claimants are asked how satisfied they were with the service they received, and choose a response from a 4-point scale which goes from ‘very satisfied’ to ‘very dissatisfied’. Their answers are grouped together to show the percentage of claimants who were satisfied ('fairly satisfied' or 'very satisfied') and the percentage who were dissatisfied ('very dissatisfied' or 'fairly dissatisfied').</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The population sampled is made up of claimants who have had contact with DWP within the previous 3 months. It does not include everyone who has ever been a claimant. The survey is carried out quarterly across the financial year, and interviews about 15,500 claimants per year (about 4,000 every 3 months). The DWP Claimant Service and Experience Survey results are ‘weighted’ to compensate for different response rates between different groups of respondents, so that the findings fairly represent the range of disability and out-of-work benefit claimants, as well as pension claimants.</p>
<p>The satisfaction measure is derived from survey responses to a single question in the survey, which is then aggregated to provide an overall measure of satisfaction.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>For data quality reasons, it is Department for Work and Pensions policy to suppress any values based on fewer than 40 responses.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages are rounded to 0 decimal places. However, gaps and differences between figures have been calculated on unrounded data. Percentages have been rounded up if greater than or equal to 0.5, and rounded down if less than 0.5 of a percentage point. </p>
<p>Estimates based on survey responses are subject to sampling error.</p>
