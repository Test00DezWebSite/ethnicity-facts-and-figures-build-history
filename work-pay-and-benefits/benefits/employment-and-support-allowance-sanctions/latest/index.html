         This data counts the number of decisions to sanction, not the individuals being sanctioned. An individual can have more than one sanction in a month. For this reason, it isn’t possible to tell whether differences in the percentage of sanctions between ethnic groups are because more people in a particular group received sanctions, or because a number of individuals in that group received multiple sanctions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not all individuals reported their ethnicity: a subgroup of ‘unreported ethnicity’ is included if you

         . Some ethnic groups may be more likely than others to not report their ethnicity, and are therefore more likely to form part of the ‘unreported’ group. For the data to be accurate, all ethnic groups would need to be equally likely to not report their ethnicity.

         In December 2012 a new sanctions regime was introduced. This means data before this date is not directly comparable to data after it. For this reason, no data is included from the old sanctions regime on this page, but it is available on the
         <a href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/dataCatalogueExplorer.xhtml">

         These figures are subject to retrospection, which means they can be changed after being first published.

         This data measures the number of monthly decisions to reduce (‘sanction’) claimants’ Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) as a percentage of ESA claims at a point in time in the same month, broken down by ethnicity.
        </p>
        <p>
         The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of decisions to apply a sanction in a full calendar month by the claimant count at a point in time in the same month.
        </p>
        <p>
         The figures shown in the chart and table for ESA sanctions by ethnicity over time are quarterly (in other words, the total number of sanctions for the 3 calendar months per quarter). A figure labelled ‘February 2016’ in the chart or table, for example, represents the results for January, February and March 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sanctions are only applied to ESA claimants in the work-related activity group. These claimants must go to regular interviews with an adviser, who can help them with job goals and improving their skills.
        </p>
        <p>
         A person claiming ESA can be sanctioned (have their ESA reduced) if they:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          fail to attend or participate in compulsory interviews
         </li>
         <li>
          fail to undertake work-related activity
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The reduction in ESA can last for between 1 and 4 weeks after a claimant restarts the interviews or activity, depending on the number of times they have failed to comply within a given time period. If they don’t restart the interviews or activity, the sanction is open-ended.
        </p>
        <p>
         The data only includes ‘adverse’ decisions. An adverse decision is where a sanction was given to a claimant and either:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          not appealed
         </li>
         <li>
          upheld after it was appealed
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         All sanctions of this sort, whatever their length, have been included. Where months appear in the data, they refer to the calendar month in which the sanction decision was made. Where area appears in the data, it refers to the claimant's place of residence.
        </p>
        <p>
         Claimants in the ESA support group don’t have conditions to meet, and therefore aren’t sanctioned.
        </p>
        <p>
         The data about ESA claimants is broken down into 3 age groups:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          18 to 24 years
         </li>
         <li>
          25 to 49 years
         </li>
         <li>

         Therefore, the data is broken down into 6 broad groups, where ‘White Other’ refers to White ethnic minorities:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Asian/Asian British
         </li>

          Other

        </ul>
        <p>
         For data analysed both by ethnicity and by area, by age, or over time, sample sizes become smaller still. For this reason, the data is broken down into 2 broad groups:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          White – White ethnic groups (including White British and White ethnic minorities)
         </li>
         <li>
          Other – all other ethnic minorities

          Purpose of data source
         </h3>
         <p>
          The figures for the number of people claiming Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) in the Work-Related Activity Group and the number of decisions to sanction the benefit are administrative data used to produce official and experimental statistics.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
          Methodology
         </h3>
         <p>
          Figures on the number of claimants receiving benefit for Employment and Support Allowance work-related activity group (ESA (WRAG)) are based on Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) administrative data.
         </p>
         <p>
          Figures on the number of decisions to sanction (decisions to reduce the claimants’ personal allowance) are official statistics from the DWP Quarterly Benefits Summary and the dissemination tool Stat-Xplore.
         </p>
         <p>
          They include all sanctions irrespective of length. Sanctions are open-ended until the claimant re-engages with their interview or work-related activity, followed by a fixed-length sanction applied for a period of between 1 week and 4 weeks, depending on the number of failures to comply that a claimant has had within a given time period.
         </p>
         <p>
          ESA sanctions are only applied to claimants in the work-related activity group (WRAG). Claimants in the ESA Support Group do not have any conditions to meet, and therefore are not subject to sanctions.
         </p>
         <p>
          The monthly percentage is calculated by dividing the number of decisions to apply a sanction in a full calendar month by the claimant count at a point in time in the same month. 
Sanction decisions here do not include decisions that have been reversed, for example on an appeal by the claimant.
         </p>
         <p>
          The point-in-time monthly claimant count is calculated as the number of people claiming ESA on the last day of the month and is only available for every third month (quarterly).
         </p>
         <p>
          Statistics on ESA sanctions are taken from a combination of data from 3 IT systems. Recording and clerical errors can occur within these systems, and for this reason no reliance should be placed on very small numbers.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ESA (WRAG) claimant count and number of sanctions is published quarterly, giving a quarterly breakdown.
         </p>
         <p>
          The methodology for calculating the experimental monthly percentage of claimants sanctioned each month was recently changed in the August 2017 Quarterly Benefits Summary, and differs from that used here. The new methodology is based on the start and end dates of sanctions. Figures calculated using the new methodology will be available from
          <a href="https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/dataCatalogueExplorer.xhtml">
           Stat-Xplore

          at a later date.

          Rounding
         </h3>
         <p>
          The figures in the tables for total numbers of sanctions are unrounded. However, disclosure control has been applied.
         </p>
         <p>
          Percentages have been rounded to 1 decimal place.
