<li>overall, White applicants who were shortlisted for an NHS job in England in 2016/17 were 1.6 times as  likely to be appointed compared with shortlisted applicants from the ‘Other’ ethnic group (all other ethnic groups combined)</li>
<li>the same pattern was found in all 4 regions, although the difference in the likelihood of White shortlisted applicants being appointed to that of those from the Other ethnic group was largest in London and smallest in the Midlands and East region</li>
<li>White shortlisted applicants were more likely to be appointed than those from the Other ethnic group in all 4 types of NHS trust, with the relative difference largest in community provider trusts</li>
<li>shortlisted applicants from the Other ethnic group were least likely to be appointed in London, compared with the other 3 regions, and in community provider trusts, compared with the other 3 types of trust</li>

            <p>The data presents information about only 1 stage in the application process – how likely applicants from the 2 broad ethnic groups were to be appointed after being shortlisted. It is possible that people from different ethnic groups are more or less successful at other stages of the application process. Because this data does not include the numbers of applicants for posts, it is not possible to say how likely applicants from each broad group were to be shortlisted, or how likely they were to be appointed following their application. </p>
<p>Shortlisted applicants who were offered a job but turned it down are not counted as being appointed, and are therefore not included in this data.</p>
<p>Applicants reported their ethnicity on their job application form. Those who did not report their ethnicity are not included in calculating the percentages. We do not know how many applicants did not declare their ethnicity, nor whether applicants from certain ethnic groups were more or less likely to declare their ethnicity when applying for posts, or if non-reporting was higher in some trusts than in others.</p>
<p>The vacancies available in each trust, region and trust type vary by types of role and grade. Certain roles or grades may have a higher likelihood of appointment from shortlisting, and people from some ethnic groups may be more likely to apply for these. </p>
<p>You can get the data for each trust if you <a href="#download-the-data">download the data file</a>. Across trusts, there is a wide variation in the percentage of applicants who were appointed from shortlisting in both ethnic groups. This may reflect differences in recruitment practices, or be due to other factors. Caution should be used when the number of people shortlisted from either ethnic groups within a trust is small, as the likelihood of a successful appointment will be affected by small changes in the numbers appointed.</p>
<p>The percentages are based on data from the 232 NHS trusts (out of 235) who provided and confirmed the relevant data.</p>

            <p>This data measures the percentage of shortlisted applicants for NHS jobs who were subsequently appointed for the job during the 2016/17 financial year (1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017). The data includes both internal and external applicants, and is broken down by ethnicity into:</p>
<ul>
<li>White applicants</li>
<li>applicants from all other ethnic groups combined (referred to here as the ‘Other’ ethnic group)</li>
</ul>
<p>To show how much more or less likely a White applicant was to be appointed following shortlisting than an applicant from the Other ethnic group, the ‘relative likelihood’ is also given in the download file and commentary. This is calculated by dividing the percentage of shortlisted White applicants who were appointed by the percentage of shortlisted applicants from the Other ethnic group who were appointed.  </p>
<p>A relative likelihood of 2.0 would mean that a White shortlisted applicant was 2 times as likely as a shortlisted applicant from the Other ethnic group to be appointed. A relative likelihood of 0.5 would mean that a White shortlisted applicant was half as likely to be appointed as a shortlisted applicant from the Other ethnic group.</p>
<p>Data is also presented for 4 broad regions in England and the 4 types of NHS trust.</p>
<p>The regions in England are grouped as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>London (covering Greater London)</li>
<li>Midlands and East (covering the West Midlands, the East Midlands and the East)</li>
<li>North (covering the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber)</li>
<li>South (covering the South East and the South West)</li>

<p>The types of trust are:</p>

<li>acute</li>

              <p>Data was collated by each trust from sources including NHS Jobs (the application system) and the Electronic Staff Record (ESR), and it was recorded manually in some trusts. Trusts then submitted the data using the Unify2 online collection system, which allows all trusts to share their data with NHS England. The data presented here is based on the figures submitted to NHS England as at December 2017.</p>
<p>235 out of 238 NHS trusts (99%) provided data. The remaining 3 (1%) of trusts either did not submit data or the data was not of sufficient quality (for example, data contained errors or anomalies).  </p>
<p>The 2 ethnic categories used allow comparison with other data collected on the NHS workforce by ethnicity.</p>


                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages are given to 1 decimal place. You can see unrounded data if you <a href="#download-the-data">download the data file</a>.</p>
