            <p>This analysis is based on the Annual Population Survey (APS), which is a ‘sample survey’. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings') about the total population.</p>
<p>The commentary for this data includes only reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.</p>
<p>Specifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.</p>
<p>Differences are statistically significant if the results for the 2 groups or time periods being compared are within entirely different ranges.</p>
<p>As with all surveys, the estimates from the APS are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p>To increase the reliability of the data, which is taken from the Annual Population Survey (APS), the Office for National Statistics has combined the data from 2014, 2015 and 2016 into a 3-year average. The data shows respondents who were counted as not in employment, education or training at the time they were surveyed – it doesn’t measure how long they had this status within the year the survey related to.</p>
<p>Most of the ethnic groupings used here are broad because there is no breakdown of data for the more specific ethnic groups each contains. It is important to note that some of the specific ethnic groups have very different experiences to one another. For example, the Black ethnic group could include both recent migrants from Somalia and Black people born in Britain to British parents.</p>

<p>A person is considered to be not in employment, education or training (NEET) if they’re not doing one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>enrolled on an education course and are still attending or waiting for term to (re)start</li>
<li>doing an apprenticeship</li>
<li>on a government-supported employment or training programme</li>
<li>working or studying towards a qualification</li>

<li>in a job that they are temporarily away from, for example on holiday</li>
<li>doing unpaid family work, for example working in a family business</li>
</ul>
<p>A person classed as NEET is therefore not in education or training and is out of work, being either:</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The Annual Population Survey is a continuous household survey. The sample is formed from waves 1 and 5 of the Labour Force Survey (in which selected addresses are contacted every 3 months) and from regional sample boosts that are in the sample for 4 waves, spread one year apart. Most people are interviewed in person first, and later by telephone.</p>
<p>The combined data for 2014, 2015 and 2016 contains around 550,000 respondents, divided roughly equally between the 3 years. No respondent is included in more than 1 year's data.</p>
<p>Estimates presented are 3-year averages. The data shows respondents who were counted as not in employment, education or training at the time they were surveyed. It doesn’t measure how long they had this status within the year the survey related to, nor does it track any changes to their status after they were surveyed.</p>
<p>Participants are randomly selected from the Royal Mail small user Postcode address File (PAF). The NHS communal accommodation list is also used and (in the case of remote parts of Scotland) telephone directories. All eligible individuals found at the selected address may be interviewed. Individuals are included in the dataset for this analysis if they respond themselves or if a family member responds on their behalf. The complex survey design has been taken into account when calculating confidence intervals. Observed differences are considered statistically significant when the 95% confidence intervals for 2 groups don’t overlap.</p>
<p>Weighting:</p>
<p>Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.</p>
<p>For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population, which we know is around 50% male and 50% female. </p>
<p>Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable. </p>
<p>Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.</p>
<p>The combined data used here is weighted to UK population totals, using population estimates and projections from the Office for National Statistics. Weighting is done at local authority level, meaning the sample for each local authority has roughly the same age and gender characteristics as that area's general population.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>In data covering all ethnic groups together, estimates based on sample sizes of less than 15 have been suppressed.</p>
<p>‘Suppression’ means these figures have not been included in the data, to protect confidentiality and because the numbers involved are too small to draw any reliable conclusions.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages have been rounded to 1 decimal point.</p>
