         Understanding Society is a ‘sample survey’: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach ‘findings’) about the total population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Keep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. This is because they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.
        </p>
        <p>
         Results taken from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data, especially for sub-groups (for example, a specific ethnic group, age group and gender).

         This data measures households which have ‘persistently low income’ – that is, they’ve been categorised as having low income for 3 out of the 4 years surveyed.
        </p>
        <p>
         A household can be one person living alone or a group of people living at the same address sharing a kitchen and either a living room, sitting room or dining area.
        </p>
        <p>
         This measure compares a household’s income to the median income of the UK (the UK’s median income is the income in the middle of the range of all incomes arranged in order of size from lowest to highest).
        </p>
        <p>
         Two types of median income are used in this measure:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          median income before housing costs are paid (in the UK in 2014/15, this was £26,000)
         </li>
         <li>
          median income after housing costs are paid (in the UK, in 2014/15 this was £22,000)
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         Households are classed as having low income if they live on less than 60% of the UK’s median income.
        </p>
        <p>
         The data shows who falls beneath this threshold both before and after housing costs have been paid.
        </p>
        <p>
         The before housing costs (BHC) and after housing costs (AHC) show how the cost of housing has a greater or lesser impact on different groups. For example, pensioners, who may have paid off their mortgages, tend to spend a smaller proportion of their income on housing than people of working age.
        </p>
        <p>
         For people of working age the picture is different. Given that the UK’s median income before housing costs (BHC) was £26,000 in 2014/15, a working age person earning £17,000 would be earning more than 60% of median income BHC and would not be classed as having low income.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, after housing costs (AHC) the UK’s median income 2014/15 was £22,000. The same person, paying a monthly rent of £500 out of their salary of £17,000, would then be on an income of £11,000, putting them below the threshold for low income.
        </p>
        <p>
         Income measured after housing costs also deducts housing costs paid for by housing benefit. Before housing costs, this benefit may appear to represent an increase in income, but in fact goes straight to the payment of housing costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a household headed by a single person, income will go further than in a household containing adults and children. For this reason, household incomes are adjusted (or ‘equivalised’) during the statistical calculation to take into account the number of adults and children who live there. The income amounts used in this data correspond to a couple with no children. See

         The data comes from the Department for Work and Pensions’ analysis of the Understanding Society survey run by the University of Essex.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds. In these circumstances, the ethnic background of the 'household reference person' (the person in whose name the dwelling is owned or rented or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation) is used to define the ethnic background of the household.

          Purpose of data source
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Income Dynamics statistics are designed to report on income movements and the persistence of low income for various population groups.
         </p>
         <p>
          Reporting on these issues is required under UK law and the Income Dynamics statistics are intended to supplement the
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2">
           Households Below Average Income
          </a>
          (HBAI) publication. The analysis of the Income Dynamics data allows the tracking of changes in income over time for different population groups.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
          Methodology
         </h3>
         <p>
          These statistics are derived from the Understanding Society survey waves 2-6, 2010/2015.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Understanding Society survey covers the UK. Household members aged 16 or older recruited in the first survey round are visited each year to collect information on changes to their household and individual circumstances.
         </p>
         <p>
          Interviews are typically carried out face-to-face in respondents’ homes by trained interviewers.
         </p>
         <p>
          'Equivalisation' adjusts incomes for household size and composition, taking an adult couple with no children as the reference point.
         </p>
         <p>
          Weights have been applied which take the combined population subsamples, adjusting for unequal selection probabilities, differential non-response, and potential sampling error.
         </p>
         <p>
          Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining non-sampling bias.
         </p>
         <p>
          Surveys gather information from a sample rather than from the whole population. The sample is designed carefully to allow for this, and to be as accurate as possible given practical limitations such as time and cost constraints.
         </p>
         <p>
          Results from sample surveys are always estimates, not precise figures. This means that they are subject to a margin of error which can affect how changes in the numbers should be interpreted, especially in the short-term. Year-on-year movements should be treated with caution.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
