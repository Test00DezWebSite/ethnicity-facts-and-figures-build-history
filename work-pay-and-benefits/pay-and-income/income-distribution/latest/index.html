            <p>This data measures how income is spread across UK households. It divides the UK population into 5 equally sized groups of people (called ‘quintiles’) according to whether their household income is at the lowest end of the scale, the second lowest, the middle, the second highest, or at the highest end of the scale. </p>
<p>By dividing UK households into these 5 quintiles, it’s possible to see where people of different ethnicities fall on the scale. An equal income distribution between all ethnic groups would mean that exactly 20% of each ethnic group population would fall within each of the 5 income quintiles.</p>
<p>Some ethnic groups are disproportionately represented within some income quintiles, which shows an unequal income distribution between ethnicities. </p>
<p>Households are grouped according to the income and ethnicity of the highest earner, also referred to as the head of the household.  </p>
<p>Income is measured as total weekly household income from all sources after tax, national insurance and other deductions have been paid..</p>
<p>Household income is measured is measured both before housing costs (BHC) and after housing costs (AHC).</p>
<p>Income before housing costs and after housing costs show how the cost of housing has a greater or lesser impact on different groups. For example, pensioners, who may have paid off their mortgages, tend to spend a smaller proportion of their income on housing than people of working age. </p>
<p>Working age families that spend a large proportion of their income on housing costs may move from a higher quintile BHC to a lower quintile, AHC. People who spend a smaller proportion of their income on housing costs are less likely to move from a higher to a lower quintile, AHC.</p>
<p>In 2015/16, the average UK household income in the top quintile after housing costs was £45,700; in the second highest, £29,500; in the middle, £21,600; in the second lowest, £15,300; and in the lowest, £8,800.</p>
<p>In a household headed by a single person, income will go further than in a household containing adults and children. For this reason, household incomes are adjusted (or ‘equivalised’) during the statistical calculation to take into account the number of adults and children who live there.</p>

              Purpose of data source
            </h3>
              <p>The Households Below Average Income (HBAI) survey presents information on living standards in the UK and is the foremost source for data and information about household income, and inequality in the UK.</p>
            

            
            <h3 class="heading-small">
              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The data for this measure comes from the Family Resources Survey (FRS), which is used to calculate the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics.</p>
<p>The FRS is a continuous household survey which collects information on a representative sample of private households in the UK. Detailed information is recorded on: respondents’ income from all sources; housing tenure; caring needs and responsibilities; disability; expenditure on housing; education; pension scheme participation; childcare; family circumstances; and child maintenance. The survey is conducted in respondents’ homes face to face with an interviewer. </p>
<p>In the latest three-year period, financial years 2013/14 to 2015/16, the FRS sample consisted of almost 60,000 households in the UK. Surveys are conducted throughout the year and are cross-sectional, that is they are ‘snapshots’ of households over the year, and individuals are not followed up for later surveys. </p>
<p>The value for income has been ‘equivalised’ to ensure results can be compared. Equivalisation adjusts incomes for household size and composition, taking an adult couple with no children as the reference point. For example, the process of equivalisation would adjust the income of a single person upwards, so their income can be compared directly to the standard of living for a couple. </p>
<p>The ‘head of the household’, or ‘Household reference person’ (used from 2001/02 onwards) is classified as the Highest Income Householder (HIH), without regard to gender. In a single adult household the HIH is the sole householder (ie the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented). </p>
<p>If there are two or more householders the HIH is the householder with the highest personal income from all sources. If there are two or more householders who have the same income then the HIH is the eldest householder. </p>
<p>Households where every resident over the age of 16 responds to the questions is classed as fully co-operating. Only households with full-cooperation are included in the analysis. This may introduce some error as the characteristics of individuals living in households which do not respond fully may be different to those who do fully cooperate. Thus the sample will be ‘biased towards’, that is more representative of, those who do respond fully.</p>
<p>Overall, 56% of households fully cooperated with the survey, giving a sample size of 19,326 households in 2015/16. Since those responses reflect only a sample of the total population, they are weighted (scaled-up) on the basis of subnational (regional)<br />
population totals by age and sex to give estimates for the entire UK household population.</p>
<p>Income rates are reported as 3-year rolling averages to control for uncertainty in the data, that would otherwise result from small sample sizes for certain ethnic groups.</p>

              Rounding
            </h3>
              <p>Percentages are given to the nearest whole percentage point.  Due to this rounding, some figures may not add up to 100.</p>
