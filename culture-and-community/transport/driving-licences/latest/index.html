        This data measures the percentage of people aged 17 and over in England with a full driving licence, and breaks this information down by ethnicity.

       <p>
        In this case, a ‘full driving licence’ is a full driving licence valid in England, Wales and Scotland to drive either a car, or a motorcycle, scooter or moped.
       </p>
       <p>
        The data includes people who gained a driving licence in another country, as long as that licence is valid in England, Wales and Scotland. People who were disqualified from driving but hold a full licence are also included.

        The data comes from the Department for Transport’s National Travel Survey.

         Purpose of data source
        </h3>
        <p>
         The National Travel Survey (NTS) is a household survey designed to monitor long-term trends in personal travel and to inform the development of policy. It is the primary source of data on the personal travel patterns of residents of England.
        </p>
        <p>
         The survey collects information on how, why, when and where people travel, as well as factors affecting travel (for example, car availability and whether people hold driving licences).
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Methodology
        </h3>
        <p>
         The denominators are the weighted number of people aged 17 and over in the National Travel Survey (NTS) in each ethnic group. The numerators are the weighted number of people aged 17 and over in the National Travel Survey who held a full driving licence in each ethnic group.
        </p>
        <p>
         Only people who gave a valid answer to the question of whether they held a full driving licence are included in the data.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NTS data collection consists of a face-to-face interview and a 7-day self-completed written travel diary, allowing travel patterns to be linked with individual characteristics. The NTS covers travel by people in all age groups, including children.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2013, the survey coverage changed from sampling residents of England, Wales and Scotland, to residents of England only. Approximately 16,000 individuals, in 7,000 households in England, participate in the NTS each year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Responses are weighted to take account of different population demographics, but are not grossed to England totals.
        </p>
        <p>
         Statistics from the NTS were assessed during 2010 by the UK Statistics Authority. An

         was published in October 2010. The statistics were confirmed as National Statistics in July 2011.

         Suppression rules
        </h3>
        <p>
         Any cells with fewer than 100 unweighted individuals, or 300 unweighted trips, have been suppressed. This is for reasons of reliability, as the data is not disclosive in this aggregated form.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, in the latest 5-year period, there were only around 700 and 900 individuals in the 'Mixed' and 'Other' ethnic groupings respectively, so the data does not support further detailed breakdowns, as these estimates would be unreliable.
