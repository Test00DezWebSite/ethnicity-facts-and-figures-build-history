        The data is based on trips to and from school by children aged 5 to 16 years and living in England. The data includes trips to and from schools in Wales and Scotland.

       <p>
        Each trip is counted separately.

        The data doesn’t include trips over 50 miles.

       <p>
        The totals for ‘All ethnic groups’ include children whose ethnic group is not known.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of variations in the data from year to year, the Department for Transport (DfT) takes 5 years’ worth of data and works out the average for that period. It does that every year, so each year there’s a new 5-year average. For example, the published data for 2011/15 is an average of the data for each year from 2011 to 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        This type of survey methodology increases the reliability of the data. However, tests for significant differences between ethnic groups have not been carried out. Commentary has been supplied for those findings where there are relatively large differences between ethnic groups or modes of transport.

        <p>
         in the period from 2011 to 2015, the average distance to school was 2.6 miles – an increase of 0.2 miles compared to 2002/6

         Purpose of data source
        </h3>
        <p>
         The National Travel Survey (NTS) is a household survey designed to monitor long-term trends in personal travel and to inform the development of policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is the primary source of data on personal travel patterns within England, Scotland and Wales by residents of England.
        </p>
        <p>
         The survey collects information on how, why, when and where people travel as well as factors affecting travel (for example, car availability and whether people hold driving licences).
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Methodology
        </h3>
        <p>
         Surveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about everyone within that population. For those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where this isn’t the case, analysts use statistical tools to ‘weight’ the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately. They can then be used to reach meaningful conclusions.
        </p>

         Responses in this data are weighted to take account of different population demographics, but are not grossed to England totals. They’re also weighted to take into account people who didn’t respond or didn’t complete their travel diary in full.
        </p>
        <p>
         The denominator in the data is the weighted total number of trips by children aged 5 to 16 years for each ethnic group. The numerators are the weighted total length of travel, in miles or minutes, or the weighted total number of trips by children aged 5 to 16 years for each ethnic group.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NTS data collection consists of a face-to-face interview and a 7-day self-completed written travel diary, allowing travel patterns to be linked with individual characteristics. The NTS covers travel by people in all age groups, including children.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2013, the survey coverage changed from sampling residents of England, Scotland and Wales, to residents of England only. Approximately 16,000 individuals in 7,000 households in England, participate in the NTS each year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Statistics from the NTS were assessed during 2010 by the UK Statistics Authority. An

         was published in October 2010. The statistics were confirmed as National Statistics in July 2011.

         There are differences in travel between primary and secondary school children that aren’t analysed here. You can read more in the

         Suppression rules
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Department for Transport (DfT) has ‘suppressed’ very small numbers (values of fewer than 100 people or 300 trips before weighting is applied). ‘Suppression’ means these figures have not been included in the data, because the numbers involved are too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, some other figures have also been excluded. This type of exclusion, also called ‘suppression’ of data, is consistent with the DfT’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality.
