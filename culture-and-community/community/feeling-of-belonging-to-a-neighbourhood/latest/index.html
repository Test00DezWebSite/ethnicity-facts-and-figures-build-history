                    <p>This data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>overall, in 2017/18, 62% of people aged 16 and over in England said they felt strongly that they belonged to their immediate neighbourhood </li>
<li>people from the Asian (65%) and White (63%) ethnic groups were more likely to say they felt strongly that they belonged to their immediate neighbourhood than people from the Mixed (56%) and Other (44%) ethnic groups – this was in contrast with the previous year, when there was no significant difference between ethnic groups</li>
<li>in 2017/18, the percentage of people from the White, Black and Asian ethnic groups who felt strongly that they belonged to their immediate neighbourhood was similar to that in 2016/17, but there was a decrease among people in the Mixed and Other ethnic groups of 9 and 18 percentage points respectively</li>
<li>although the figures show differences between Black people and those from other ethnic groups in feeling strongly that they belonged to their immediate neighbourhood, these differences were not reliable and it is not possible to draw firm conclusions</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The Community Life Survey consists of an online or paper questionnaire, which was completed by 10,217 individuals in 2017/18.</p>
<p>The survey has deliberately surveyed more households from ethnic minority groups, (excluding White ethnic minorities). This is because the smaller populations of these groups would otherwise give less reliable results.</p>
<p>The 2016/17 and 2017/18 survey samples are large enough for the results to be broken down by 5 broad ethnic groups. Before 2016/17, interviews were conducted face to face and the sample size was smaller.  This meant it was only possible to compare White people with those from all other ethnic groups combined.</p>
<p>In the 2014/15 and 2015/16 survey years, sample sizes ranged from around 2,000 to 3,000 respondents, which was too small for reliable conclusions about differences between the White and Other ethnic groups. For these reasons, results for 2016/17 onwards are not compared with those from 2014/15 to 2015/16.</p>
<p>For earlier years, results are available for reference purposes in the published tables in the series of releases for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/community-life-survey--2">Community Life Survey</a>.</p>
<p>Weighting:</p>
<p>Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.</p>
<p>For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population, which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.</p>
<p>Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable.</p>
<p>Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population. In this case they also took account of the over-sampling in any national estimates.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Results are not published when based on fewer than 30 respondents. All the results presented here are based on sample sizes of more than 100 respondents.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Estimates in the charts and tables are given to the nearest percentage.</p>

felt strongly that they belonged to their immediate neighbourhood \r\n* people from the Asian (65%) and White (63%) ethnic groups were more likely to say they felt strongly that they belonged to their immediate neighbourhood than people from the Mixed (56%) and Other (44%) ethnic groups \u2013 this was in contrast with the previous year, when there was no significant difference between ethnic groups\r\n* in 2017/18, the percentage of people from the White, Black and Asian ethnic groups who felt strongly that they belonged to their immediate neighbourhood was similar to that in 2016/17, but there was a decrease among people in the Mixed and Other ethnic groups of 9 and 18 percentage points respectively\r\n* although the figures show differences between Black people and those from other ethnic groups in feeling strongly that they belonged to their immediate neighbourhood, these differences were not reliable and it is not possible to draw firm conclusions", "table": {"category":
