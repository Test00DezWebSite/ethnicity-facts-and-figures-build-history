The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for Other ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nThe commentary only refers to differences between groups where they are 'statistically significant'. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.\r\n\r\nResults by ethnic group are available in the reference tables of the latest [Community Life Survey publication](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/community-life-survey-2016-17)", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "For this data, the number of people surveyed (the \u2018sample size\u2019) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about specific ethnic categories.

It is carried out through questionnaires that respondents complete online or on paper. The 2016/17 survey consisted of a sample size of 10,256 individuals.\r\n\r\nThe survey has deliberately surveyed more households from Other minority backgrounds. This is because the smaller populations of these groups would otherwise give less reliable results.\r\n\r\nThe results for this sample have been weighted to be representative of the population of England in terms of age, gender, degree level education, housing tenure, region, household size and ethnic group. This helped to compensate for any differences between people who were more likely to respond to the survey and those less likely to. It also took account of the over-sampling of Other minority groups in any national estimates.\r\n\r\nIn 2016/17, the survey moved from face-to-face to online/paper data collection. This change in data collection method means results for 2016/17 are not comparable with results for earlier years. \r\n\r\nThe 2016/17 survey sample is large enough for the results to be broken down by the broad ethnic groups. In previous years, sample sizes for this survey were conducted face-to-face and in more recent years they had considerably smaller sample sizes. The smaller samples sizes meant it was only possible to compare ethnic groups at a very high level, comparing White adults with adults of all Other ethnic groups. In the most recent survey years, sample sizes were anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 respondents, which was too small for reliable conclusions about differences between the White and Other ethnic groups. For these reasons, results for 2016/17 are not being compared with those from previous surveys. \r\n\r\nFor earlier years, results for \u2018White\u2019 and \u2018Other\u2019 are available in the published tables in the Department for Communities and Local Government\u2019s [series of releases for the Community Life Survey]( https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/community-life-survey--2).", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "Results are not published when based on fewer than 30 respondents.
