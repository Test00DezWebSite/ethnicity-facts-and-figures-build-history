            <p>This data measures the percentage of households in ‘fuel poverty’ in England over time. The data is broken down by ethnic group.</p>
<p>Fuel poverty in England is measured using the Low Income High Costs (LIHC) indicator. Under the LIHC indicator, the people in a household are considered to be fuel poor if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the cost of fuel needed to keep their home warm, well-lit and with running appliances and hot water for everyday use is greater than the average for households across the country (the national median level)</li>
<li>subtracting this amount of fuel costs, all their regular debt payments and expenses (including a mortgage) from their income results in an income below the official poverty line</li>

<p>Three factors determine whether a household is fuel poor:</p>

<li>household income</li>
<li>household energy requirements</li>

              Purpose of data source
            </h3>
              <p>The main purposes of fuel poverty statistics (based on survey data) are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>give a comprehensive view on current trends in fuel poverty in England</li>
<li>let government measure its progress in meeting its statutory fuel poverty target for households in England</li>
</ul>
<p>The fuel poverty target is to improve the energy efficiency rating of fuel-poor households to a minimum rating of band C by 2030.</p>
            

            
            <h3 class="heading-small">
              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>Fuel poverty statistics use data collected from the English Housing Survey (EHS). </p>
<p>The EHS is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government. </p>
<p>It collects information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>people’s housing circumstances</li>
<li>household income</li>
<li>the condition and energy efficiency of housing</li>
</ul>
<p>The fuel poverty analysis uses a random sample of approximately 12,000 households from the EHS. These households had both a face-to-face interview and a physical survey carried out by a qualified surveyor. </p>
<p>On average, around 10% to 12% (1,400) of the surveyed households were in fuel poverty. Of these 1,400, less than 20% (about 200) were from an ethnic minority household (other than White ethnic minorities).</p>
<p>Weighting</p>
<p>Surveys seek information about a particular group of people – we call this the target population.</p>
<p>Every target population will have a particular age and gender profile – for example, teachers are predominantly female and under 50. Some target populations will also have a regional profile – for example, they might be clustered in a particular part of the country. </p>
<p>Surveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (reach ‘findings’) about everyone within that population.</p>
<p>For those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.</p>
<p>Where this isn’t the case (because some people haven’t responded, for example) analysts use statistical tools to ‘weight’ the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately. They can then be used to reach meaningful conclusions. </p>
<p>Weights are applied to the EHS sample to produce fuel poverty estimates for the 22.6 million households in England as a whole.</p>

              Suppression rules
            </h3>
              <p>Any values based on fewer than 30 households have been ‘suppressed’.</p>
<p>‘Suppression’ means these figures have not been included in the data because the numbers involved are too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.</p>
<p>This is standard policy for English Housing Survey data, from which fuel poverty is derived.</p>

              Disclosure control
            </h3>
              <p>The data is deposited in the UK Data Archive, as part of the data used for the English Housing Survey.</p>
<p>There are 2 levels of access for fuel poverty datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>End-User Licence</li>
<li>Special Licence</li>
</ul>
<p>The content and disclosure control depend on the type of application made. </p>
<p>Disclosure-controlled data is available under the End-User Licence (which contains the 2015 data relating to this analysis). </p>
<p>A more detailed dataset with additional fuel poverty model inputs is available after permission has been granted by the fuel poverty team under Special Licence. </p>
<p>Within both sets of data, ethnicity is given as either ‘White’ (this includes White British and White ethnic minorities) or ‘ethnic minority’.</p>
