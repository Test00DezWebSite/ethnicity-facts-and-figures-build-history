      <ul>
       <li>
        in 2015/16, 4.3 million (19%) of the 22.6 million households in England lived in a non-decent home
       </li>
       <li>
        compared with the 19% of White British households who lived in a non-decent home, White Irish households were less likely to live in a non-decent home and Pakistani households were more likely to do so
       </li>
       <li>
        the survey estimates show other differences between ethnic minority households living in non-decent homes compared to White British households in this sample – however, these are not reliable enough to draw any conclusions about differences between these groups in  the total population

       <p>
        Compared with White British households, ethnic minority households tend to be younger, to have lived in England for a shorter time and to be located in urban areas. They are also likely to live in larger households and in rented accommodation.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has added together 2 years of data (2014/15 and 2015/16) from the English Housing Survey (EHS).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information about households in the EHS Headline and Annual reports is normally based on a 12-month period (April to March). As the statistics on this page combine data from 2014/15 and 2015/16, the numbers here may not match the figures in those individual reports.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commentary has focused on findings based on subgroups of at least 30 households to ensure that we report reliable findings. For this reason, estimates for Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller, Mixed White and Asian, and Any Other Black  households have not been presented in some of the tables or charts.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not possible to look in detail at the characteristics of the type of households that live in non-decent homes. This is because the sample sizes of individual ethnic groups when further broken down by other characteristics such as income, socio-economic group, region or age are not large enough to give reliable estimates.
       </p>
       <p>
        The EHS is a ‘sample survey’. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach ‘findings’) about the total population.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, EHS findings include the percentage of households living in non-decent homes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless stated otherwise, the commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.

        This data measures the percentage of households in England who lived in a ‘non-decent’ home broken down by ethnicity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Percentages shown refer to the share of all households for that ethnic group in England that live in properties that are non-decent.
       </p>
       <p>
        A home is non-decent if it fails to meet the

         Decent Homes Standard
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        For a home to be considered ‘decent’ it must:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         meet the current minimum standard for housing set out in law
        </li>
        <li>
         be in a reasonable state of repair
        </li>
        <li>
         have reasonably modern facilities and services
        </li>
        <li>
         have effective insulation and heating
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The figures come from the English Housing Survey 2014/15 and 2015/16.
       </p>
       <p>
        The survey involves face-to-face interviews with about 13,300 randomly selected households every year. These are used to make estimates for the 22.6 million households in England.
       </p>
       <p>
        The EHS is a national survey of people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of homes in England.
       </p>
       <p>
        The information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The EHS has ethnicity information on the household reference person as well as all other members of the household. The ‘household reference person’ is the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented, or who is otherwise responsible for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some households have people from different ethnic backgrounds; where this happens, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nearly every household reference person – more than 99.8% interviewed – provided information on their ethnicity.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the geographical level, the data is shown for the nine regions of England: North East, North West, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England, London, South East and the South West.

      Summary
     </h3>
     <p>
      This data shows that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        19% of White British households lived in non-decent homes – around 3.6 million households
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Pakistani households were more likely to live in non-decent homes – 29% (84,000) of these households were living in a non-decent home
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        White Irish households were less likely to live in non-decent homes – 9% (17,000) of these households were living in a non-decent home
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        some ethnic groups in this sample are as or less likely to live in a non-decent home as White British households – namely, Any other White, White and Black Caribbean, Indian, Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean and Any Other ethnic background – however, these are not reliable enough to draw any conclusions about differences between these groups in the total population
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        similarly, some ethnic groups in this sample are more likely to live in a non-decent home than White British households – namely, White and Black African, Chinese, Other Asian, Black African and Arab households – however, these are not reliable enough to draw conclusions about differences between these groups in the population as a whole

         Purpose of data source
        </h3>
        <p>
         The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). 
It collects information about:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          people’s housing circumstances
         </li>
         <li>
          the condition and energy efficiency of housing
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Methodology
        </h3>
        <p>
         The EHS consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          face-to-face interviews with a random sample of about 13,300 households a year
         </li>
         <li>
          a physical inspection of the homes of about 6,000 of the interviewed households – these are selected at random and carried out by a surveyor
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The surveyor also inspects a random sample of about 200 properties identified by the interviewer as vacant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Weighting:
        </p>
        <p>
         Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population.
For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.
        </p>
        <p>
         Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the EHS, weighting makes the results more representative of the 22.6 million households in England.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Rounding
        </h3>
        <p>
         Estimates in the charts and tables are given to the nearest whole number.

         Suppression rules
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has ‘suppressed’ estimates based on fewer than 30 households.
        </p>
        <p>
         ‘Suppression’ means these figures have not been included in the data because the numbers involved are too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, some other figures have also been excluded.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Disclosure control
        </h3>
        <p>
         The data is deposited in the UK Data Archive, after applying a wide range of disclosure control.
        </p>
        <p>
         Strictly disclosure-controlled data in the form of derived variables is available under the End-User Licence (for example, ethnicity is given as White/ethnic minority).
        </p>
        <p>
         Data sets with some more details are made available under Special Licence after the user has applied to the English Housing Survey team for access.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data that could potentially reveal someone’s identity (such as a postcode) is available only through UKDA Secure Access. To gain access, a user must complete special training, including on disclosure control.
