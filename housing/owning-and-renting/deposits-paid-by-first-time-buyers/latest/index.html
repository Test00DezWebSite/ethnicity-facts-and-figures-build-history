        Compared with White British households, ethnic minority households tend to be younger, to have lived in England for a shorter time and to be located in urban areas. They are also likely to live in larger households and in rented accommodation.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the Department for Communities and Local Government has added together 2 years of data (2014/15 and 2015/16) from the English Housing Survey (EHS).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information about households in the EHS Headline and Annual reports is normally based on a 12-month period (April to March). As the statistics on this page combine data from 2014/15 and 2015/16, the numbers here may not match the figures in those individual reports.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commentary has focused on findings based on subgroups of at least 30 households to ensure that we report reliable findings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The EHS is a ‘sample survey’. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach ‘findings’) about the total population.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, EHS findings include the average deposit paid by first-time buyers. In 2015/16, the average deposit that first-time buyers paid on their home was £45,358.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless stated otherwise, the commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they  are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample..

      This data shows that:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        White British first-time buyers in routine and manual occupations paid a larger deposit (around £35,000) than those from other ethnic groups (around £17,000)

       <p>
        White British first-time buyers in higher managerial, administrative and professional occupations in this sample paid a smaller deposit on average compared with all other ethnic groups; however, these estimates are not reliable enough to draw any conclusions about differences between these groups in the total population

         Purpose of data source
        </h3>
        <p>
         The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government. 
It collects information about:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          people’s housing circumstances
         </li>
         <li>
          the condition and energy efficiency of housing
         </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Methodology
        </h3>
        <p>
         The EHS consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          face-to-face interviews with a random sample of about 13,300 households a year
         </li>
         <li>
          a physical inspection of the homes of about 6,000 of the interviewed households – these are selected at random and carried out by a surveyor
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The surveyor also inspects a random sample of about 200 properties identified by the interviewer as vacant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Weighting:
        </p>
        <p>
         Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.
        </p>
        <p>
         Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the EHS, weighting makes the results more representative of the 22.6 million households in England.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Rounding
        </h3>
        <p>
         Estimates in the charts and tables are given to the nearest whole number.
More detailed estimates to 1 decimal place are available in the downloads.

         Suppression rules
        </h3>
        <p>
         The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has ‘suppressed’ estimates based on fewer than 30 households.
        </p>
        <p>
         ‘Suppression’ means these figures have not been included in the data because the numbers involved are too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, some other figures have also been excluded.
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-small">
         Disclosure control
        </h3>
        <p>
         The data is deposited in the UK Data Archive, after applying a wide range of disclosure control.
        </p>
        <p>
         Strictly disclosure-controlled data in the form of derived variables is available under the End-User Licence (for example, ethnicity is given as White/ethnic minority).
        </p>
        <p>
         Data sets with some more details are made available under Special Licence after the user has applied to the English Housing Survey team for access.
        </p>
        <p>
         Data that could potentially reveal someone’s identity (such as a postcode) is available only through UKDA Secure Access. To gain access, a user must complete special training, including on disclosure control.
