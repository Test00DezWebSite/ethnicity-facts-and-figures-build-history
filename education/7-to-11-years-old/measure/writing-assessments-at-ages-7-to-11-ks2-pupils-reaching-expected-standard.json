This successfully matches around 60 to 70% of pupils. \r\n\r\nAdditional, more complex, routines are then applied to match as many of the remaining pupils as possible, up to around 98%. The coverage of the local authority (LA) and regional statistics is state-funded schools only in England.\r\n\r\nConfidence intervals for progress results are calculated for a school based on a specific cohort of pupils. A school may have been just as effective, but have performed differently with a different set of pupils. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, some pupils may be more likely to achieve high or low results, independently of which school they attend. To account for this natural uncertainty, 95% confidence intervals around progress scores are provided as a proxy for the range of scores within which each school\u2019s underlying performance can be confidently said to lie. \r\n\r\nSchool scores should be interpreted alongside their associated confidence intervals. If the lower bound of the school\u2019s confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the school has achieved greater than average progress compared to pupils with similar starting points nationally. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, if the upper bound is below zero, then the school has made less than average progress. Where a confidence interval overlaps zero, this means that the school\u2019s progress score is not significantly different from the national average.\r\n\r\nThe system of national curriculum levels is no longer used by the government to report on end of key stage assessment.  \r\n \r\nFor this reason, the previous 'expected progress' measure, based on pupils making at least two levels of progress between key stage 1 and key stage 2, will not appear in the performance tables or Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through school Self-Evaluation (RAISEonline) in 2016. \r\n \r\nThis measure has been replaced by 'value added' progress measures in reading, writing and mathematics. \r\n \r\nThere is no 'target' for the amount of progress an individual pupil is expected to make, and any amount of progress a pupil makes contributes towards the [school's progress scores](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/primary-school-accountability).\r\n \r\nBecause of the changes to the curriculum, figures for 2016 are not comparable to those for earlier years.", "data_type": "Linked Administrative Data", "suppression_rules": "", "disclosure_control": "The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure that our published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.\r\n\r\nIn the statistical first release (SFR), an 'x' indicates that a figure has been suppressed due to small numbers. Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with the departmental statistical policy on confidentiality. \r\n\r\nFigures for the Isles of Scilly and City of London are suppressed in the key stage 2 provisional SFR as these LAs have a single school and we do not publish school level in the performance tables at the time of the provisional SFR. These figures become unsuppressed in the revised SFR as school level figures are already published in the performance tables. Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these LAs by summing the figures for the other LAs in the region. \r\n\r\nIn the school level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer will be suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort, for example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, we would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.", "estimation": "Progress scores are given to 1 decimal place", "type_of_statistic": "", "qmi_url":
