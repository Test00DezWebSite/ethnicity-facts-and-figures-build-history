            <p>Start Up Loans were first awarded in 2012. They were specifically designed to support people from disadvantaged social groups to start or grow a business. Evidence suggests people from these groups have difficulty getting loans from more traditional sources. Although start-up loans were available from 2012, the vast majority of loans were awarded from 2013 onwards, and so data are not provided for 2012 due to low counts.</p>
<p>In the early years of the scheme, promotion was targeted at people from the Black and Mixed ethnic groups. This is reflected in the rates for 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>The information for the economically active population aged 18 and over is taken from the Annual Population Survey (APS).</p>
<p>The APS is a ‘sample survey’. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings') about the total population.</p>
<p>As with all surveys, the estimates from the APS are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p>Recipients of Start Up Loans report their own ethnicity. In 2017, 8% of recipients did not report their ethnicity. Rates are not calculated for this group as the proportion of those not reporting their ethnicity is inconsistent with the group who did not report their ethnicity in the APS (which was only 0.06% of APS respondents).</p>

                    <p>This data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>overall, 8,895 Start Up Loans were received in 2017, at a rate of 2.7 loans per 10,000 economically active people; the number and rate of loans has decreased steadily since 2014, when 14,765 loans were awarded at a rate of 4.6 loans per 10,000 people</li>
<li>in 2017, people of Mixed ethnicity were nearly 3 times as likely to receive a Start Up Loan compared with the overall rate, while Asian people were just over half as likely to receive a Start Up Loan compared with the overall rate</li>
<li>the rate of Black people receiving a Start Up Loan fell from 26.9 per 10,000 in 2013 to 5.7 per 10,000 in 2017, a fall of nearly 80%; this may reflect the targeting of loans towards people from the Black ethnic group in the early years of the scheme</li>
<li>the rate of people from the Mixed ethnic group receiving a Start Up Loan rose from 14.0 per 10,000 in 2013 to 24.9 per 10,000 in 2014, but fell to 7.5 per 10,000 in 2017; again, this may reflect the targeting of loans towards people from the Mixed ethnic group in the early years of the scheme</li>
<li>the rate of White people receiving a Start Up Loan in 2017 was about the same as in 2013</li>
<li>although the rate for the Other ethnic group was higher in 2017 than in 2013, the rate has been falling since 2014</li>

                  <p>The Annual Population Survey (APS) is the largest ongoing household survey in the UK. It is based on interviews with members of randomly selected households.</p>

<li>personal characteristics</li>
<li>labour market status</li>
<li>work characteristics</li>
<li>education</li>
<li>health</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of the APS is to provide information on important social and socio-economic variables at local levels, such as labour market estimates.</p>
<p>The published statistics also allow government to monitor estimates on a range of issues between Censuses.</p>

half as likely to receive a Start Up Loan compared with the overall rate\r\n* the rate of Black people receiving a Start Up Loan fell from 26.9 per 10,000 in 2013 to 5.7 per 10,000 in 2017, a fall of nearly 80%; this may reflect the targeting of loans towards people from the Black ethnic group in the early years of the scheme\r\n* the rate of people from the Mixed ethnic group receiving a Start Up Loan rose from 14.0 per 10,000 in 2013 to 24.9 per 10,000 in 2014, but fell to 7.5 per 10,000 in 2017; again, this may reflect the targeting of loans towards people from the Mixed ethnic group in the early years of the scheme\r\n* the rate of White people receiving a Start Up Loan in 2017 was about the same as in 2013\r\n* although the rate for the Other ethnic group was higher in 2017 than in
