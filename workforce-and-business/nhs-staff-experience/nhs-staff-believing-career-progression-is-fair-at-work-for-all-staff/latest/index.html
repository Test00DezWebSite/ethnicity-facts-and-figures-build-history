            <div class="bullets spaced-out">
                <ul>
<li>in 2017, overall 84% of NHS staff said that their NHS trust gave all staff an equal chance of promotion or career progression – 87% of White staff believed this, compared with 72% of staff from all other ethnic groups combined</li>
<li>in all 4 broad regions of England, and all 4 types of NHS trust, White staff were more likely than staff from all other ethnic groups combined to say that their trust gave all staff an equal chance of promotion or career progression</li>

            <p>This data shows whether NHS staff thought there was fairness in career progression or promotion in their NHS trust amongst all staff. It does not show whether they felt that they had been treated fairly personally. A member of staff from one ethnic group who sees unfair treatment of a member of staff from another ethnic group may therefore report a perception of unfairness, even if they themselves have been treated fairly. </p>
<p>All NHS trusts have to take part in the NHS Staff Survey, but the number of survey respondents varies between them. Caution should be used when comparing trusts where the results are based on a small number of respondents.</p>
<p>The survey was completed by staff in 235 NHS trusts. Data from 3 of the trusts was excluded from this analysis because they had fewer than 11 respondents from the ‘Other’ ethnic group (that is, staff from all ethnic groups except the White ethnic group), making the results unreliable. This means the percentages shown here are based on 232 trusts (99%), with a total of 312,873 respondents.</p>
<p>Some trusts selected a sample of staff to take part in the survey, while others invited all their staff to respond. Where a trust selected a sample, the sample may not have been representative of all staff in that trust. Staff who completed the survey might have had different experiences at work than staff who didn’t do so.</p>
<p>The data only includes staff who said what their ethnicity was. Staff from some ethnic groups might have been less likely to report their ethnicity or reply to certain survey questions. Therefore, the results may not be representative of all staff working for NHS trusts. No adjustments have been made to the results to compensate for any possible biases.</p>
<p>There is a unknown margin of error around all the estimates presented, so the percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number. The commentary excludes any differences observed in the data of a few percentage points, as they may not indicate real differences. It is possible that some of the larger differences observed in the data, including those which we have commented on, are also within the margin of error, but we’re not able to assess this.</p>

            </h3>
              <p>235 NHS trusts took part in the survey. In 3 trusts, there were fewer than 11 responses from staff in the Other ethnic group, and so the results have not been included. Staff were sent a paper questionnaire or an email containing a link to an online questionnaire. </p>
<p>The regional split represents the regions in place at the time of the survey was carried out.</p>
<p>The survey was administered by the Survey Coordination Centre on behalf of NHS England.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>The data doesn’t include figures from trusts where fewer than 11 staff from either the White or Other ethnic group responded to the survey.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>

                  <p>The purpose of the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) is to collect information on differences in the experience and treatment of NHS staff depending on their ethnicity, with a view to reducing these differences.</p>
<p>The NHS Staff Survey has been conducted every year since 2003. It asks NHS staff in England about their experiences of working for the NHS. The survey provides information about staff experience across the NHS in England and aims to highlight it to stakeholders and employers. All NHS trusts have to take part in the survey.</p>
