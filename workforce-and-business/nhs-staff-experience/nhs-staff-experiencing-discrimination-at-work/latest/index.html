            <p>Participation is mandatory for NHS trusts but the number of survey respondents varies between them. Caution should be used when comparing trusts where the results are based on a small number of respondents.  </p>
<p>The NHS Staff Survey was completed by NHS staff in 235 NHS trusts. Data from 2 of the trusts was suppressed to improve reliability because they had fewer than 11 respondents from the Other ethnic group. This means the percentages shown here are based on 233 trusts (99%), with a total of 452,446 respondents.</p>
<p>Some trusts selected a sample of staff to take part in the survey, while others invited all their staff to respond. Where a trust selected a sample, the sample may not have been representative of all staff in that trust. Staff who completed the survey might have had different experiences at work than staff who didnâ€™t do so.</p>
<p>The data only includes staff who reported their ethnic group. Staff from some ethnic groups might be less likely to report their ethnicity or reply to certain survey questions. Therefore, the results may not be representative of all staff working for NHS trusts. No adjustments have been made to the results to compensate for any possible biases. </p>
<p>There will be a margin of error around all the estimates presented - some of which may be large, but we do not know the sizes of these margins of error. </p>
<p>We have therefore not commented on differences observed in the data of a few percentage points, as they may not indicate real differences. It is possible that some of the larger differences observed in the data, including those which we have commented on, are also within the margin of error, but weâ€™re not able to assess this.</p>

            <p>This data shows the percentage of people who, when responding to the NHS Staff Survey, said they had experienced discrimination at work from a manager, team leader or other colleagues in the last 12 months (2017). </p>
<p>For this data, the number of people surveyed (the â€˜sample sizeâ€™) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about specific ethnic categories. Therefore, the data is presented for 2 broad ethnic groups: White and Other.</p>
<p>The percentages are calculated by dividing the number of people from each ethnic group who said theyâ€™d experienced discrimination from a colleague over the last 12 months by the total number of survey respondents from their ethnic group.</p>
<p>Data is also presented for 4 broad regions in England and the 4 types of NHS trust.</p>
<p>The regions in England are grouped as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>London (covering Greater London)</li>
<li>Midlands and East (covering the West Midlands, the East Midlands and the East of England)</li>
<li>North (covering the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber)</li>
<li>South (covering the South East and the South West)</li>
</ul>
<p>The types of NHS trust are:</p>
<ul>
<li>hospital (also known as acute)</li>
<li>ambulance</li>
<li>community provider </li>
<li>mental health</li>
</ul>
<p>The data does not include staff working in:</p>
<ul>
<li>public bodies such as Public Health England and the Care Quality Commission</li>
<li>independent (non-NHS) healthcare providers</li>
<li>social enterprises</li>
<li>clinical commissioning groups</li>

                <p>The purpose of the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) is to collect information on differences in the experience and treatment of NHS staff depending on their ethnicity, with a view to reducing these differences.</p>
<p>The NHS Staff Survey has been conducted every year since 2003. It asks NHS staff in England about their experiences of working for the NHS. The survey provides information about staff experience across the NHS in England and aims to highlight it to stakeholders and employers. Participation is mandatory for NHS trusts.</p>
