            <div class="bullets spaced-out">
                <ul>
<li>as at 1 April 2018, 6.8% of court judges and 10.6% of tribunal judges whose ethnicity was known were from either the Asian, Black, Mixed or Other ethnic group </li>
<li>among those whose ethnicity was known, White judges made up the highest percentage of both court and tribunal judges, at 93.2% and 89.4% respectively; Asian judges made up the second highest percentage, at 3.1% and 4.8% respectively</li>
<li>16.7% of non-legal tribunal members were from either the Asian, Black, Mixed or Other ethnic group, an increase of around 0.4 percentage points since 2017</li>
<li>Asian members of the judiciary were less likely to be court judges, which requires a legal background (at 16.3%), than to be non-legal tribunal members, who tend to have a specific area of expertise (at 68.0%); in contrast, members of the judiciary of Mixed ethnicity were more likely to be court judges (at 40.2%) than to be non-legal tribunal members (at 32.4%)</li>

            <p>Judges and non-legal members of the judiciary are asked to declare their ethnicity voluntarily on taking up of a new appointment. 16% of court judges, 8% of tribunal judges and 10% of non-legal members of the judiciary didn't declare their ethnicity on taking up their appointment, and there is currently no facility for judicial office holders to update their declaration. Non-declaration adds some uncertainty to the breakdowns by ethnicity, in particular when considering smaller groups, such as breakdowns by role.</p>
<p>The source of the data is an electronic human resources system for the judiciary that contains data imported from a number of other systems. Differences in the age profiles of judges and non-legal members of the judiciary make it difficult to compare their ethnic make up both with each other and with the general population. For example, as at 1 April 2018, 46% of all judges were at least 60 years old. According to the 2011 Census of England and Wales, people from ethnic minority groups make up a smaller percentage of the population as the population gets older.</p>
<p>Judges require a substantial legal background, while non-members of the judiciary usually have a specific area of expertise (for example medicine). There is no onward progression from being a non-legal tribunal member to a judge, as the nature of the roles require entirely different professional expertise and experience.</p>

<ul>
<li>as at 1 April 2018, there were 2,509 court judges, 1,571 tribunal judges, and 2,798 non-legal members of the judiciary whose ethnicity was known</li>
<li>of court judges whose ethnicity was known, 6.8% were from either the Asian, Black, Mixed or Other ethnic group;  10.6% of tribunal judges, and 16.7% of non-legal members were from one of these ethnic groups</li>
<li>White judges made up the highest percentage of both court and tribunal judges, at 93.2% and 89.4% respectively, followed by Asian judges, at 3.1% and 4.8% respectively</li>
<li>people from the Asian ethnic group made up 11.6% of non-legal tribunal members, making them the second largest group after White members (83.3%)</li>
<li>469 court judges (16%) didn't declare their ethnicity â€“ this is a higher percentage than among tribunal judges (8%) and non-legal members of the judiciary (10%), and adds greater uncertainty to the figures for judges, in particular when looking at smaller groups</li>

                    <p>This data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>as at 1 April 2018, there were 6,173 White members of the judiciary, followed by 478 Asian members, 120 Black members, 105 members from the Other ethnic group, and 102 with Mixed ethnicity; ethnicity wasnâ€™t known for a further 925 members</li>
<li>Asian members of the judiciary were less likely to be court judges, which requires a legal background (at 16.3%), than to be non-legal tribunal members, who tend to have a specific area of expertise (at 68.0%)</li>
<li>members of the judiciary with Mixed ethnicity were more likely to be court judges (at 40.2%) than to be non-legal tribunal members (at 32.4%)</li>
<li>of the 925 members of the judiciary who didnâ€™t declare their ethnicity, around half (469) were court judges â€“ therefore, compared with other judicial roles, thereâ€™s a greater chance that the percentage of the judiciary who were court judges is underestimated for some ethnic groups</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The data breaks down the number of court judges in England and Wales by ethnicity. It does the same for judges and non-legal members of the judiciary in tribunals in England and Wales (excluding tribunals that are the responsibility of the devolved Welsh Government), and in employment tribunals in Scotland. </p>
<p>If people have more than one role, only their primary role is included in the data.</p>
<p>The data includes tribunals that are administered by HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service (HMCTS) and that fall within the responsibilities of the Senior President of Tribunals â€“ this accounts for most tribunals in England and Wales, and a small number of employment tribunals in Scotland.</p>
<p>Data is extracted from the staff administrative system and represents the point in time at which the extracts were taken. </p>
<p>Judges and non-legal members of the judiciary declare their ethnicity on a voluntary basis on taking up of a new appointment. There is currently no facility to update, amend, or make new declarations aside from upon taking up of a new appointment.</p>


                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages are rounded to 1 decimal point.</p>
