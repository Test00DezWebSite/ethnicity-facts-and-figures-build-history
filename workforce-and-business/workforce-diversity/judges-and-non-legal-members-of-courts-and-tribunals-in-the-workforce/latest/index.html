            <div class="bullets spaced-out">
                <ul>
<li>as at 1 April 2017, 6.7% of court judges whose ethnicity was known were from either the Asian, Black, Mixed or Other ethnic group</li>
<li>among those whose ethnicity was known, White judges made up the highest percentage of both court and tribunal judges, at 93.4% and 89.8% respectively, followed by Asian judges, at 3.0% and 4.5% respectively</li>
<li>10.1% of tribunal judges and 16.3% of non-legal tribunal members were from either the Asian, Black, Mixed or Other ethnic group – these figures are roughly the same as those for 2016</li>
<li>Asian members of the judiciary were less likely to be court judges, which requires a legal background (at 16.9%), than to be non-legal tribunal members, who tend to have a specific area of expertise (at 66.8%); in contrast, judiciary members with Mixed ethnicity were more likely to be court judges (at 39.8%) than to be non-legal tribunal members (at 31.6%)</li>

<p>The source of the data is an electronic human resources system for the judiciary that contains data imported from a number of other systems, and not all of the data has been validated.</p>
<p>Differences in the age profiles of judges and non-legal members of the judiciary make it difficult to compare their ethnic make up both with each other and with the general population. For example, as at 1 April 2017, 45% of all judges were at least 60 years old.

<p>Judges require a substantial legal background, while non-members of the judiciary usually have a specific area of expertise like medicine. There is no onward progression from being a non-legal tribunal member to a judge.</p>

                    <p>This data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>as at 1 April 2017, there were 2,611 court judges, 1,653 tribunal judges, and 2,799 non-legal members of the judiciary whose ethnicity was known</li>
<li>6.7% of court judges whose ethnicity was known were from either the Asian, Black, Mixed or Other ethnic group; among tribunals, 10.1% of tribunal judges, and 16.3% of non-legal members were from one of these ethnic groups</li>
<li>White judges made up the highest percentage of both court and tribunal judges, at 93.4% and 89.8% respectively, followed by Asian judges, at 3.0% and 4.5% respectively</li>
<li>people from the Asian ethnic group made up 11.0% of non-legal tribunal members, making them the second largest group after White members (83.7%)</li>
<li>523 court judges (17%) didn't declare their ethnicity – this is a higher percentage than among tribunal judges (7%) and non-legal members of the judiciary (10%), and adds greater uncertainty to the figures for judges</li>

                    <p>This data shows that: </p>
<ul>
<li>as at 1 April 2017, there were 6,267 White members of the judiciary, followed by 461 Asian members, 126 Black members, 111 members from the Other ethnic group, and 98 with Mixed ethnicity; ethnicity wasn’t known for a further 984 members</li>
<li>Asian members of the judiciary were less likely to be court judges, which requires a legal background (at 16.9%), than to be non-legal tribunal members, who tend to have a specific area of expertise (at 66.8%) </li>
<li>members of the judiciary with Mixed ethnicity were more likely to be court judges (at 39.8%) than to be non-legal tribunal members (at 31.6%)</li>
<li>of the 984 members of the judiciary who didn’t declare their ethnicity, more than half (523) were court judges – therefore, compared with other judicial roles, there’s a greater chance that the percentage of the judiciary who were court judges is underestimated for some ethnic groups</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The data breaks down the number of court judges in England and Wales by ethnicity. It does the same for judges and non-legal members of the judiciary in tribunals in England and Wales, and in employment tribunals in Scotland. </p>
<p>If people have more than one role, only their primary role is included in the data.</p>
<p>The data includes tribunals that are administered by HM Courts &amp; Tribunals Service (HMCTS) and that fall within the responsibilities of the Senior President of Tribunals – this accounts for most tribunals in England and Wales, and a small number of employment tribunals in Scotland.</p>
<p>Data is extracted from the staff administrative system and represents the point in time at which the extracts were taken. </p>
<p>Judges and non-legal members of the judiciary record their ethnicity on a voluntary basis.</p>


                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages are rounded to 1 decimal point.</p>
