            <p>The data presents information about only 1 stage in the application process – how likely applicants from the 2 broad ethnic groups were to be appointed after being shortlisted. It is possible that people from different ethnic groups are more or less successful at other stages of the application process. Because this data does not include the numbers of applicants for posts, it is not possible to say how likely applicants from each broad group were to be shortlisted, or how likely they were to be appointed following their application.</p>
<p>Shortlisted applicants who were offered a job but turned it down are not counted as being appointed, and are therefore not included in this data.</p>
<p>Applicants reported their ethnicity on their job application form. Those who did not report their ethnicity are not included in calculating the percentages. We do not know how many applicants did not declare their ethnicity, nor whether applicants from certain ethnic groups were more or less likely to declare their ethnicity when applying for posts, or if non-reporting was higher in some trusts than in others.</p>
<p>The vacancies available in each trust, region and trust type vary by types of role and grade. Certain roles or grades may have a higher likelihood of appointment from shortlisting, and people from some ethnic groups may be more likely to apply for these.</p>
<p>You can get the data for each trust if you <a href="#download-the-data">download the data</a>. Across trusts, there is a wide variation in the percentage of applicants who were appointed from shortlisting in both ethnic groups. This may reflect differences in recruitment practices, or be due to other factors. Caution should be used when the number of people shortlisted from either ethnic groups within a trust is small, as the likelihood of a successful appointment will be affected by small changes in the numbers appointed.</p>
<p>The percentages are based on data from the 229 NHS trusts (out of 231) who provided and confirmed the relevant data.</p>

            <p>This data measures the percentage of shortlisted applicants for NHS jobs who were subsequently appointed for the job during the 2017/18 financial year (1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018). The data includes both internal and external applicants, and is broken down by ethnicity into:</p>
<ul>
<li>White applicants</li>
<li>applicants from all other ethnic groups combined – referred to here as the ‘Other’ ethnic group, and as ‘BME (Black and Minority Ethnic)’ in NHS England WRES reports</li>
</ul>
<p>To show how much more or less likely a White applicant was to be appointed following shortlisting than an applicant from the Other ethnic group, the ‘relative likelihood’ is also given in the download file and commentary. This is calculated by dividing the percentage of shortlisted White applicants who were appointed by the percentage of shortlisted applicants from the Other ethnic group who were appointed.</p>
<p>A relative likelihood of 2.0 would mean that a White shortlisted applicant was twice as likely as a shortlisted applicant from the Other ethnic group to be appointed. A relative likelihood of 0.5 would mean that a White shortlisted applicant was half as likely to be appointed as a shortlisted applicant from the Other ethnic group.</p>
<p>Data is also presented for 4 broad regions in England and the 4 types of NHS trust.</p>
<p>The regions in England are grouped as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>London (covering Greater London)</li>
<li>Midlands and East (covering the West Midlands, the East Midlands and the East)</li>
<li>North (covering the North West, the North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber)</li>
<li>South (covering the South East and the South West)</li>

<p>The types of trust are:</p>
<ul>
<li>acute</li>
<li>ambulance</li>
<li>community provider</li>
<li>mental health</li>

<p>The data does not include job applicants for:</p>

<li>independent (non-NHS) healthcare providers</li>

Trusts then submitted the data using the Strategic Data Collection System (SDCS), which allows all trusts to share their data with NHS England. This data is based on the figures submitted to NHS England using the Strategic Data Collection System as at January 2019 and is subject to change.</p>
<p>229 out of 231 NHS trusts (99.1%) provided data for this indicator. The remaining two (0.9%) of trusts either did not submit data or the data was not of sufficient quality (for example, data contained errors or anomalies).</p>
