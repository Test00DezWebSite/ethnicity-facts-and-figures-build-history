Each of these time periods is reported as a percentage of the total number of people who are unemployed within each ethnic group.\r\n\r\nA person is counted as unemployed if all 3 of the following apply:\r\n\r\n* they are out of work\r\n* they are available to start work in the next 2 weeks \r\n* they have either been actively looking for work in the past 4 weeks or have found a job and are waiting to start it\r\n\r\nThis is the International Labour Organisation\u2019s definition of \u2018unemployment\u2019 and is often used in published UK statistics. It gives more accurate figures for unemployment than alternatives such as a count of claimants for out-of-work benefits.\r\n\r\nThe figures come from the Annual Population Survey, which is a general household survey covering the UK. It uses data from the Labour Force Survey as well as other local data.", "summary": "* the length of time that White people spent in unemployment is, on average, shorter than for people from all Other ethnic groups\r\n\r\n* compared to White people, a higher percentage of people from all Other ethnic groups were unemployed for 3 months or more, while a lower percentage were unemployed for 0 to 3 months", "geographic_coverage": "England, Wales and Scotland", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2004 to 2016", "need_to_know": "The Annual Population Survey (APS) is a \u2018sample survey\u2019. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings') about the total population. \r\n\r\nThe commentary for this data includes only reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.\r\n\r\nAs with all surveys, the estimates from the APS are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.\r\n\r\nSmaller numbers of survey respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that estimates for all Other ethnic groups are more unreliable than estimates for White people (which includes White British and White ethnic minorities).\r\n\r\nResults taken from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data, especially for sub-groups (for example, a specific ethnic group, age group and gender). \r\n\r\nWhen looking at data for \u2018All\u2019 groups, any values based on fewer than 30 responses have been withheld, and when further breaking down the data by ethnicity, any values based on fewer than 100 responses have been withheld. This is to protect confidentiality or because the numbers involved are too small to draw any reliable conclusions.\r\n\r\nFor some respondents, the length of time spent in unemployment was not recorded, and for this reason some of the percentages do not add up to 100%. \r\n\r\nData is taken  from the APS to get more specific data such as detail about local authority areas. Broader figures may differ slightly from reports published by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Office for National Statistics that also use the Labour Force Survey (LFS).\r\n\r\nChanges were made to the LFS ethnicity questions in January to March 2011, to bring them more in line with census data collection on these topics. In April to June 2011 further changes were made to the ethnicity questions to bring them in line with Scottish census data collection. As a result, there may be some inconsistencies with estimates from earlier than 2011.", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "For this data, the number of people surveyed (the \u2018sample size\u2019) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about specific ethnic categories.

This means it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings\u2019) about the total population (such as time in unemployment). Most people are interviewed face to face at first, and later by telephone. The sample is formed partly from waves 1 and 5 of the Labour Force Survey (in which selected addresses are contacted every 3 months) and partly from boost cases which are in the sample for 4 waves, spread one year apart. \r\n\r\nParticipants are randomly selected from the Royal Mail Postcode address File (PAF) although we also use the NHS communal accommodation list and (in the case of remote parts of Scotland) telephone directories. Anyone aged 16 years or older at the selected address may be interviewed. Only households where either the individual responds or a family member responds on their behalf are included in the dataset used for this analysis. The complex survey design has been taken into account when calculating confidence intervals. \r\n\r\nWeighting\r\nThe achieved sample of approximately 275,000 undergoes weighting which is structured at local authority level and uses age and sex dimensions. The Office for National Statistics population estimates and projections are used as the basis for this weighting process. \r\n\r\nWeighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.\r\n\r\nFor example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female. \r\n\r\nStatisticians rebalance or \u2018weight\u2019 the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable. \r\n\r\nSurvey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "In data covering all ethnic groups together, estimates based on sample sizes of less than 30 have been suppressed.
