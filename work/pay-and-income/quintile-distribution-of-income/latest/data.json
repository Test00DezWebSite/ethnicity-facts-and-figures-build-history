{"guid": "DWP 036", "title": "Income distribution", "measure_summary": "This data measures how income is spread across UK households. It divides the UK population into 5 equally sized groups of people (called \u2018quintiles\u2019) according to whether their household income is at the lowest end of the scale, the second lowest, the middle, the second highest, or at the highest end of the scale. \r\n\r\nBy dividing UK households into these 5 quintiles, it\u2019s possible to see where people of different ethnicities fall on the scale. An equal income distribution between all ethnic groups would mean that exactly 20% of each ethnic group population would fall within each of the 5 income quintiles.\r\n\r\nSome ethnic groups are disproportionately represented within some income quintiles, which shows an unequal income distribution between ethnicities. \r\n\r\nHouseholds are grouped according to the income and ethnicity of the highest earner, also referred to as the head of the household. The head of household\u2019s income is measured as their average income over 3 years. \r\n\r\nIncome is measured as total weekly household income from all sources after tax, national insurance and other deductions have been paid..\r\n\r\nHousehold income is measured is measured both before housing costs (BHC) and after housing costs (AHC).\r\n\r\nIncome before housing costs and after housing costs show how the cost of housing has a greater or lesser impact on different groups. For example, pensioners, who may have paid off their mortgages, tend to spend a smaller proportion of their income on housing than people of working age. \r\n\r\nWorking age families that spend a large proportion of their income on housing costs may move from a higher to a lower quintile, AHC. People who spend a smaller proportion of their income on housing costs are less likely to move from a higher to a lower quintile, AHC.\r\n\r\nIn 2015/16, the average UK household income in the top quintile was \u00a384,747; in the second highest, \u00a343,261; in the middle, \u00a326,983; in the second lowest, \u00a313, 877; and in the lowest, \u00a37,153.\r\n\r\nIn a household headed by a single person, income will go further than in a household containing adults and children. For this reason, household incomes are adjusted (or \u2018equivalised\u2019) during the statistical calculation to take into account the number of adults and children who live there.", "summary": "* UK households are divided into 5 groups, or \u2018quintiles\u2019, with average incomes ranging from \u00a37,152 in the lowest quintile to \u00a384,747 in the highest quintile\r\n\r\n* after housing costs, over half of households headed by an Asian, Black or Other ethnic group person fell into the two lowest income quintiles\r\n\r\n* after housing costs, 42% of White British households fell into the two highest income quintiles, compared to 21% of Black households, 25% of Other ethnic households, 26% of Asian households, 31% of Mixed race households and 36% of White Other households", "geographic_coverage": "UK", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2015/2016", "need_to_know": "Each household is categorised according to the ethnicity of the head of the household. Because households may also contain members of other, different ethnic groups, this data is not a completely accurate reflection of the distribution of household income by ethnicity.\r\n\r\nThe Households Below Average Income (HBAI) is a \u2018sample survey\u2019. It collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings') about the total population. \r\n\r\nThe commentary for this data includes only reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.\r\n\r\nAs with all surveys, the estimates from the HBAI are subject to a degree of uncertainty as they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.\r\n\r\nSmaller numbers of survey respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that estimates for all Other ethnic groups are more unreliable than estimates for White people (which includes White British and White ethnic minorities).\r\n\r\nResults taken from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data, especially for sub-groups (for example, a specific ethnic group, age group and gender). \r\n\r\nUsing a three-year average for household income minimises the risk of uncertainty to an extent.", "ethnicity_definition_summary": "For this data, the number of people surveyed (the \u2018sample size\u2019) was too small to draw any firm conclusions about specific ethnic categories.

Detailed information is recorded on: respondents\u2019 income from all sources; housing tenure; caring needs and responsibilities; disability; expenditure on housing; education; pension scheme participation; childcare; family circumstances; and child maintenance. The survey is conducted in respondents\u2019 homes face to face with an interviewer. \r\n\r\nIn the latest three-year period, financial years 2013/14 to 2015/16, the FRS sample consisted of almost 60,000 households in the UK. Surveys are conducted throughout the year and are cross-sectional, that is they are \u2018snapshots\u2019 of households over the year, and individuals are not followed up for later surveys. \r\n\r\nThe value for income has been \u2018equivalised\u2019 to ensure results can be compared. Equivalisation adjusts incomes for household size and composition, taking an adult couple with no children as the reference point. For example, the process of equivalisation would adjust the income of a single person upwards, so their income can be compared directly to the standard of living for a couple. \r\n\r\nThe \u2018head of the household\u2019, or \u2018Household reference person\u2019 (used from 2001/02 onwards) is classified as the Highest Income Householder (HIH), without regard to gender. In a single adult household the HIH is the sole householder (ie the person in whose name the accommodation is owned or rented). \r\n\r\nIf there are two or more householders the HIH is the householder with the highest personal income from all sources. If there are two or more householders who have the same income then the HIH is the eldest householder. \r\n\r\nHouseholds where every resident over the age of 16 responds to the questions is classed as fully co-operating. Only households with full-cooperation are included in the analysis. This may introduce some error as the characteristics of individuals living in households which do not respond fully may be different to those who do fully cooperate. Thus the sample will be \u2018biased towards\u2019, that is more representative of, those who do respond fully.\r\n\r\nOverall, 56% of households fully cooperated with the survey, giving a sample size of 19,326 households in 2015/16. Since those responses reflect only a sample of the total population, they are weighted (scaled-up) on the basis of subnational (regional)  \r\npopulation totals by age and sex to give estimates for the entire UK household population.\r\n\r\nIncome rates are reported as 3-year rolling averages to control for uncertainty in the data, that would otherwise result from small sample sizes for certain ethnic groups.", "data_type": "Survey", "suppression_rules": "Values calculated based on counts of less than 100 have been suppressed.", "disclosure_control": "We round numbers.
