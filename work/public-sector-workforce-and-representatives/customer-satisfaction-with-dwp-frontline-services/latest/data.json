These are selected randomly from all claimants who, in the previous 3 months, have either made a new claim or have contacted DWP about a change of circumstances for an existing claim.\r\n\r\nClaimants are asked how satisfied they were with the service they received, and offered a 4-point scale to reply, from \u2018very satisfied\u2019 to \u2018very dissatisfied\u2019. Their answers are grouped together to show the percentage of claimants who are satisfied (very or fairly satisfied) and the percentage who are dissatisfied (fairly or very dissatisfied).", "summary": "* in 2015/16, Asian and White British claimants were more likely to be satisfied (\u2018very satisfied\u2019 or \u2018fairly satisfied\u2019) with Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) services (85%), while claimants from the Any Other ethnic group were least likely to be satisfied (74%)\r\n\r\n* from 2014/15 to 2015/16, the percentage of Black claimants who were satisfied with DWP services rose from 75% to 83% \r\n\r\n* from 2014/15 to 2015/16, the percentage of White British claimants who were satisfied with DWP services rose from 83% to 85%", "geographic_coverage": "England, Wales and Scotland", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2014/15 to 2015/16", "need_to_know": "The data collected through the DWP Claimant Service and Experience Survey is used to make generalisations about the total population. As with any sample used to make observations on the total population, the estimates statisticians make are subject to a degree of uncertainty. The degree of uncertainty is greater for a group in which the number of participants is small, so it will be greatest for minority ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nThe commentary for this data only includes reliable, or \u2018statistically significant\u2019, findings.\r\n\r\nFindings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and reflect the total population rather than just the survey sample.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings. \r\n\r\nThe commentary has focused on findings based on subgroups of at least 100 people to ensure that we report reliable findings.\r\n\r\nAll surveys carry the risk of biased results if some types of people were less likely to respond than others. To compensate for this, the responses to this survey have been weighted so they better reflect characteristics of the target population.\r\n\r\nSatisfaction figures are estimates based on respondents who have had recent contact with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). This means they may not reflect the whole claimant population. Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding and the way some participants answer the question.
