                            <p>These figures are based on the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW). </p>
<p>The CSEW is a face-to-face survey in which adults aged 16 or over living in England and Wales are asked about their experiences of a selected range of criminal offences in the 12 months prior to the interview. </p>
<p>The CSEW is able to capture a broad range of victim-based crimes experienced by those interviewed, not just those that have been reported to, and recorded by, the police. However, there are some high harm but relatively lower-volume offences, such as homicide and sexual offences, which are not included in its main estimates. </p>
<p>Since October 2015, the survey has included fraud and computer misuse. However, as data from before this point is not available, the statistics and commentary presented here exclude fraud and computer misuse offences.</p>
<p>Estimates based on a larger number of respondents are generally more reliable. Therefore, the smaller numbers of respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that estimates for these groups are less reliable than estimates for White people. </p>
<p>Estimates based on fewer than 50 responses are excluded, as they are considered less reliable. </p>
<p>In some instances, 3 years' worth of CSEW data have been combined. This allows us to increase the numbers of respondents and increase the reliability of the data, providing more detailed breakdowns of the data.</p>
<p>CSEW is a sample survey and produces estimates with a margin of error around them, so users should consider this when interpreting data. </p>

White:
<em> English/ Welsh/ Scottish/ Northern Irish/ British
</em> Irish
<em> Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller

Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups:

However, in cases where the number of people surveyed (the ‘sample size’) was too small to draw any firm conclusions, the CSEW breaks the data down into the following broader categories.
Either 5 ethnic categories: 
<em> White
</em> Mixed / Multiple ethnic groups
<em> Asian / Asian British
</em> Black / African / Caribbean / Black British
<em> Other ethnic group
Or 2 ethnic categories: 
</em> White and Other, that is, White ethnic groups (including White British and White ethnic minorities) compared with all other ethnic minorities</p>

                                      The data is all drawn from the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW), which is a continuous survey, and broken down by ethnic group, as reported by survey respondents. 

CSEW estimates are based on analysis of structured face-to-face interviews carried out using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). Data are weighted and two stages are used in the weighting of the CSEW sample.  In 2015/16, the response rate was 72%.

The CSEW is a household sample survey and, as such, estimates are based on a representative sample of the population of England and Wales aged 16 and over. A sample, as used in the CSEW, is a small-scale representation of the population from which it is drawn. 

The CSEW collects information from approximately 35,000 households each year. Since those responses reflect only a fraction of the total population of England and Wales, a procedure is used to give different weights to different households and individuals based on their sex / age / region composition in such a way that the weighted distribution of responding household and individuals in these households matches the known distribution in the population as a whole. 

First, weights are applied to the raw data to compensate for unequal address selection probabilities (given, some areas are more populated than others), to compensate for the observed variation in response rates between different types of neighbourhood, to compensate for situations in which only one dwelling unit can be selected in multiple ‘dwelling unit&#39; households and to account for different probabilities of a respondent being selected based on different sized households.

Second, calibration weighting is used to make adjustments for known differentials in response rates between different regions and between different age by six sub-groups.

                                      Estimates from the Crime Survey for England and Wales have National Statistics status. 

National Statistics are a subset of official statistics which have been certified by the UK Statistics Authority as compliant with its Code of Practice for Official Statistics, including requirements on disclosure control. Estimates based on a number of respondents (known as the &#39;unweighted base&#39;) that is less than 50 are suppressed as these estimates are deemed to be less reliable.

                                      Accuracy: Since the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is based on a sample of the population, estimates have a margin of quantifiable and non-quantifiable error associated with them. Non-quantifiable error includes:

* when respondents have recalled crimes in the reference period that actually occurred outside that period
* crimes that did occur in the reference period that were not mentioned at all (either because respondents failed to recall a fairly trivial incident or, conversely, because they did not want to disclose an incident, such as a domestic assault)
* respondents saying they reported crimes to police when they did not (a &#39;socially desirable&#39; response)
* some incidents reported during the interview being miscoded (&#39;interviewer or coder error&#39;)

Coverage issues: The CSEW does not cover those living in communal establishments (such as care homes, student halls of residence and prisons), or crimes against commercial or public sector bodies.
