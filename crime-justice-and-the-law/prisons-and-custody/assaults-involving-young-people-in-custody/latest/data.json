It doesn\u2019t indicate if an incident involved people of the same or different ethnicities, for example, or whether one individual was involved in multiple incidents. The data only breaks down assault rates by ethnicity, and therefore should be used for a general, high-level assessment of the issue. \r\n \r\nEstimates based on a larger number of respondents are generally more reliable.
