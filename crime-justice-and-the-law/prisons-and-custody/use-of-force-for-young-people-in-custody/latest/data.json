It also includes planned interventions to prevent serious harm to one or more young people. \r\n\r\nIn exceptional circumstances, force can be used as a last-resort means of resolving \u2018passive non-compliance\u2019, where it is in the interests of the young person or other young people.\r\n\r\nThe downloadable data also includes the average number of use of force incidents per month at each YOI.", "summary": "* force is used with young White people less frequently than with young people from Other ethnic groups\r\n\r\n* the greatest difference in how often force is used with young White people and with Other ethnic groups was found in Werrington YOI and Cookham Wood YOI", "geographic_coverage": "England and Wales", "lowest_level_of_geography": "National", "time_covered": "2015/16", "need_to_know": "Simple conclusions or direct comparisons between ethnicities or institutions should be avoided, because the circumstances are different for each use of force.\r\n\r\nThe use of force figures reflect the average number of incidents in each month, based on incidents over the year.
